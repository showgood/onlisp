* Preface
This book is intended for anyone who wants to become a better Lisp
programmer. It assumes some familiarity with Lisp, but not necessarily
extensive programming experience. The first few chapters contain a fair
amount of review. I hope that these sections will be interesting to more
experienced Lisp programmers as well, because they present familiar
subjects in a new light.

It's difficult to convey the essence of a programming language in one
sentence, but John Foderaro has come close:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  "Lisp is a programmable programming language."
#+END_QUOTE

There is more to Lisp than this, but the ability to bend Lisp to one's
will is a large part of what distinguishes a Lisp expert from a novice.
As well as writing their programs down toward the language, experienced
Lisp programmers build the language up toward their programs. This book
teaches how to program in the bottom-up style for which Lisp is
inherently well-suited.

** Bottom-up Design
Bottom-up design is becoming more important as software grows in
complexity. Programs today may have to meet specifications which are
extremely complex, or even open-ended. Under such circumstances, the
traditional top-down method sometimes breaks down. In its place there
has evolved a style of programming quite different from what is
currently taught in most computer science courses: a bottom-up style in
which a program is written as a series of layers, each one acting as a
sort of programming language for the one above. X Windows and TeX are
examples of programs written in this style.

The theme of this book is twofold: that Lisp is a natural language for
programs written in the bottom-up style, and that the bottom-up style is
a natural way to write Lisp programs. On Lisp will thus be of interest
to two classes of readers. For people interested in writing extensible
programs, this book will show what you can do if you have the right
language. For Lisp programmers, this book offers a practical explanation
of how to use Lisp to its best advantage.

The title is intended to stress the importance of bottom-up programming
in Lisp. Instead of just writing your program in Lisp, you can write
your own language on Lisp, and write your program in that.

It is possible to write programs bottom-up in any language, but Lisp is
the most natural vehicle for this style of programming. In Lisp,
bottom-up design is not a special technique reserved for unusually large
or difficult programs. Any substantial program will be written partly in
this style. Lisp was meant from the start to be an extensible language.
The language itself is mostly a collection of Lisp functions, no
different from the ones you define yourself. What's more, Lisp functions
can be expressed as lists, which are Lisp data structures. This means
you can write Lisp functions which generate Lisp code.

A good Lisp programmer must know how to take advantage of this
possibility. The usual way to do so is by defining a kind of operator
called a macro. Mastering macros is one of the most important steps in
moving from writing correct Lisp programs to writing beautiful ones.
Introductory Lisp books have room for no more than a quick overview of
macros: an explanation of what macros are,together with a few examples
which hint at the strange and wonderful things you can do with them.
Those strange and wonderful things will receive special attention here.
One of the aims of this book is to collect in one place all that people
have till now had to learn from experience about macros.

Understandably, introductory Lisp books do not emphasize the differences
between Lisp and other languages. They have to get their message across
to students who have, for the most part, been schooled to think of
programs in Pascal terms. It would only confuse matters to explain that,
while defun looks like a procedure definition, it is actually a
program-writing program that generates code which builds a functional
object and indexes it under the symbol given as the first argument.

One of the purposes of this book is to explain what makes Lisp different
from other languages. When I began, I knew that, all other things being
equal, I would much rather write programs in Lisp than in C or Pascal or
Fortran. I knew also that this was not merely a question of taste. But I
realized that if I was actually going to claim that Lisp was in some
ways a better language, I had better be prepared to explain why.

When someone asked Louis Armstrong what jazz was, he replied "If you
have to ask what jazz is, you'll never know." But he did answer the
question in a way: he showed people what jazz was. That's one way to
explain the power of Lisp--to demonstrate techniques that would be
difficult or impossible in other languages. Most books on
programming--even books on Lisp programming--deal with the kinds of
programs you could write in any language. On Lisp deals mostly with the
kinds of programs you could only write in Lisp. Extensibility, bottom-up
programming, interactive development, source code transformation,
embedded languages--this is where Lisp shows to advantage.

In principle, of course, any Turing-equivalent programming language can
do the same things as any other. But that kind of power is not what
programming languages are about. In principle, anything you can do with
a programming language you can do with a Turing machine; in practice,
programming a Turing machine is not worth the trouble.

So when I say that this book is about how to do things that are
impossible in other languages, I don't mean "impossible" in the
mathematical sense, but in the sense that matters for programming
languages. That is, if you had to write some of the programs in this
book in C, you might as well do it by writing a Lisp compiler in C
first. Embedding Prolog in C, for example--can you imagine the amount of
work that would take? Chapter 24 shows how to do it in 180 lines of
Lisp.

I hoped to do more than simply demonstrate the power of Lisp, though. I
also wanted to explain why Lisp is different. This turns out to be a
subtle question--too subtle to be answered with phrases like "symbolic
computation." What I have learned so far, I have tried to explain as
clearly as I can.

** Plan of the Book
Since functions are the foundation of Lisp programs, the book begins
with several chapters on functions. Chapter 2 explains what Lisp
functions are and the possibilities they offer. Chapter 3 then discusses
the advantages of functional programming, the dominant style in Lisp
programs. Chapter 4 shows how to use functions to extend Lisp. Then
Chapter 5 suggests the new kinds of abstractions we can define with
functions that return other functions. Finally, Chapter 6 shows how to
use functions in place of traditional data structures.

The remainder of the book deals more with macros than functions. Macros
receive more attention partly because there is more to say about them,
and partly because they have not till now been adequately described in
print. Chapters 7--10 form a complete tutorial on macro technique. By
the end of it you will know most of what an experienced Lisp programmer
knows about macros: how they work; how to define, test, and debug them;
when to use macros and when not; the major types of macros; how to write
programs which generate macro expansions; how macro style differs from
Lisp style in general; and how to detect and cure each of the unique
problems that afflict macros.

Following this tutorial, Chapters 11--18 show some of the powerful
abstractions you can build with macros. Chapter 11 shows how to write
the classic macros--those which create context, or implement loops or
conditionals. Chapter 12 explains the role of macros in operations on
generalized variables. Chapter 13 shows how macros can make programs run
faster by shifting computation to compile-time. Chapter 14 introduces
anaphoric macros, which allow you to use pronouns in your programs.
Chapter 15 shows how macros provide a more convenient interface to the
function-builders defined in Chapter 5. Chapter 16 shows how to use
macro-defining macros to make Lisp write your programs for you. Chapter
17 discusses read-macros, and Chapter 18, macros for destructuring.

With Chapter 19 begins the fourth part of the book, devoted to embedded
languages. Chapter 19 introduces the subject by showing the same
program, a program to answer queries on a database, implemented first by
an interpreter and then as a true embedded language. Chapter 20 shows
how to introduce into Common Lisp programs the notion of a continuation,
an object representing the remainder of a computation. Continuations are
a very powerful tool, and can be used to implement both multiple
processes and nondeterministic choice. Embedding these control
structures in Lisp is discussed in Chapters 21 and 22, respectively.
Nondeterminism, which allows you to write programs as if they had
foresight, sounds like an abstraction of unusual power. Chapters 23 and
24 present two embedded languages which show that nondeterminism lives
up to its promise: a complete ATN parser and an embedded Prolog which
combined total about 200 lines of code.

The fact that these programs are short means nothing in itself. If you
resorted to writing incomprehensible code, there's no telling what you
could do in 200 lines. The point is, these programs are not short
because they depend on programming tricks, but because they're written
using Lisp the way it's meant to be used. The point of Chapters 23 and
24 is not how to implement ATNs in one page of code or Prolog in two,
but to show that these programs, when given their most natural Lisp
implementation, simply are that short. The embedded languages in the
latter chapters provide a proof by example of the twin points with which
I began: that Lisp is a natural language for bottom-up design, and that
bottom-up design is a natural way to use Lisp.

The book concludes with a discussion of object-oriented programming, and
particularly CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System. By saving this topic
till last, we see more clearly the way in which object-oriented
programming is an extension of ideas already present in Lisp. It is one
of the many abstractions that can be built on Lisp.

A chapter's worth of notes begins on page 387. The notes contain
references, additional or alternative code, or descriptions of aspects
of Lisp not directly related to the point at hand. Notes are indicated
by a small circle in the outside margin, like this. There is also an
Appendix (page 381) on packages.

Just as a tour of New York could be a tour of most of the world's
cultures, a study of Lisp as the programmable programming language draws
in most of Lisp technique. Most of the techniques described here are
generally known in the Lisp community, but many have not till now been
written down anywhere. And some issues, such as the proper role of
macros or the nature of variable capture, are only vaguely understood
even by many experienced Lisp programmers.

** Examples in Preface
Lisp is a family of languages. Since Common Lisp promises to remain a
widely used dialect, most of the examples in this book are in Common
Lisp. The language was originally defined in 1984 by the publication of
Guy Steele's Common Lisp: the Language (CLTL1). This definition was
superseded in 1990 by the publication of the second edition (CLTL2),
which will in turn yield place to the forthcoming ANSI standard.

This book contains hundreds of examples, ranging from single expressions
to a working Prolog implementation. The code in this book has, wherever
possible, been written to work in any version of Common Lisp. Those few
examples which need features not found in CLTL1 implementations are
explicitly identified in the text. Later chapters contain some examples
in Scheme. These too are clearly identified.

The code is available by anonymous FTP from endor.harvard.edu, where
it's in the directory pub/onlisp. Questions and comments can be sent

** Acknowledgements
While writing this book I have been particularly thankful for the help
of Robert Morris. I went to him constantly for advice and was always
glad I did. Several of the examples in this book are derived from code
he originally wrote, including the version of for on page 127, the
version of aand on page 191, match on page 239, the breadth-first
true-choose on page 304, and the Prolog interpreter in Section 24.2. In
fact, the whole book reflects (sometimes, indeed, transcribes)
conversations I've had with Robert during the past seven years. (Thanks,
rtm!)

I would also like to give special thanks to David Moon, who read large
parts of the manuscript with great care, and gave me very useful
comments. Chapter 12 was completely rewritten at his suggestion, and the
example of variable capture on page 119 is one that he provided.

I was fortunate to have David Touretzky and Skona Brittain as the
technical reviewers for the book. Several sections were added or
rewritten at their suggestion. The alternative true nondeterministic
choice operator on page 397 is based on a suggestion by David Toureztky.

Several other people consented to read all or part of the manuscript,
including Tom Cheatham, Richard Draves (who also rewrote alambda and
propmacro back in 1985), John Foderaro, David Hendler, George Luger,
Robert Muller, Mark Nitzberg, and Guy Steele.

I'm grateful to Professor Cheatham, and Harvard generally, for providing
the facilities used to write this book. Thanks also to the staff at
Aiken Lab, including Tony Hartman, Janusz Juda, Harry Bochner, and
Joanne Klys.

The people at Prentice Hall did a great job. I feel fortunate to have
worked with Alan Apt, a good editor and a good guy. Thanks also to Mona
Pompili, Shirley Michaels, and Shirley McGuire for their organization
and good humor.

The incomparable Gino Lee of the Bow and Arrow Press, Cambridge, did the
cover. The tree on the cover alludes specifically to the point made on
page 27.

This book was typeset using LaTeX, a language written by Leslie Lamport
atop Donald Knuth's TeX, with additional macros by L. A. Carr, Van
Jacobson, and Guy Steele. The diagrams were done with Idraw, by John
Vlissides and Scott Stanton. The whole was previewed with Ghostview, by
Tim Theisen, which is built on Ghostscript, by L. Peter Deutsch. Gary
Bisbee of Chiron Inc. produced the camera-ready copy.

I owe thanks to many others, including Paul Becker, Phil Chapnick, Alice
Hartley, Glenn Holloway, Meichun Hsu, Krzysztof Lenk, Arman Maghbouleh,
Howard Mullings, NancyParmet, Robert Penny, Gary Sabot, Patrick Slaney,
Steve Strassman, Dave Watkins, the Weickers, and Bill Woods.

Most of all, I'd like to thank my parents, for their example and
encouragement; and Jackie, who taught me what I might have learned if I
had listened to them.

I hope reading this book will be fun. Of all the languages I know, I
like Lisp the best, simply because it's the most beautiful. This book is
about Lisp at its lispiest. I had fun writing it, and I hope that comes
through in the text. Paul Graham

* 1. The Extensible Language
Not long ago, if you asked what Lisp was for, many people would have
answered "for artificial intelligence." In fact, the association between
Lisp and AI is just an accident of history. Lisp was invented by John
McCarthy, who also invented the term "artificial intelligence." His
students and colleagues wrote their programs in Lisp, and so it began to
be spoken of as an AI language. This line was taken up and repeated so
often during the brief AI boom in the 1980s that it became almost an
institution.

Fortunately, word has begun to spread that AI is not what Lisp is all
about. Recent advances in hardware and software have made Lisp
commercially viable: it is now used in Gnu Emacs, the best Unix
text-editor; Autocad, the industry standard desktop CAD program; and
Interleaf, a leading high-end publishing program. The way Lisp is used
in these programs has nothing whatever to do with AI.

If Lisp is not the language of AI, what is it? Instead of judging Lisp
by the company it keeps, let's look at the language itself. What can you
do in Lisp that you can't do in other languages? One of the most
distinctive qualities of Lisp is the way it can be tailored to suit the
program being written in it. Lisp itself is a Lisp program, and Lisp
programs can be expressed as lists, which are Lisp data structures.
Together, these two principles mean that any user can add operators to
Lisp which are indistinguishable from the ones that come built-in.

** 1.1 Design by Evolution
Because Lisp gives you the freedom to define your own operators, you can
mold it into just the language you need. If you're writing a
text-editor, you can turn Lisp into a language for writing text-editors.
If you're writing a CAD program, you can turn Lisp into a language for
writing CAD programs. And if you're not sure yet what kind of program
you're writing, it's a safe bet to write it in Lisp. Whatever kind of
program yours turns out to be, Lisp will, during the writing of it, have
evolved into a language for writing that kind of program.

If you're not sure yet what kind of program you're writing? To some ears
that sentence has an odd ring to it. It is in jarring contrast with a
certain model of doing things wherein you (1) carefully plan what you're
going to do, and then (2) do it. According to this model, if Lisp
encourages you to start writing your program before you've decided how
it should work, it merely encourages sloppy thinking.

Well, it just ain't so. The plan-and-implement method may have been a
good way of building dams or launching invasions, but experience has not
shown it to be as good a way of writing programs. Why? Perhaps it's
because computers are so exacting. Perhaps there is more variation
between programs than there is between dams or invasions. Or perhaps the
old methods don't work because old concepts of redundancy have no
analogue in software development: if a dam contains 30% too much
concrete, that's a margin for error, but if a program does 30% too much
work, that is an error.

It may be difficult to say why the old method fails, but that it does
fail, anyone can see. When is software delivered on time? Experienced
programmers know that no matter how carefully you plan a program, when
you write it the plans will turn out to be imperfect in some way.
Sometimes the plans will be hopelessly wrong. Yet few of the victims of
the plan-and-implement method question its basic soundness. Instead they
blame human failings: if only the plans had been made with more
foresight, all this trouble could have been avoided. Since even the very
best programmers run into problems when they turn to implementation,
perhaps it's too much to hope that people will ever have that much
foresight. Perhaps the plan-and-implement method could be replaced with
another approach which better suits our limitations.

We can approach programming in a different way, if we have the right
tools. Why do we plan before implementing? The big danger in plunging
right into a project is the possibility that we will paint ourselves
into a corner. If we had a more flexible language, could this worry be
lessened? We do, and it is. The flexibility of Lisp has spawned a whole
new style of programming. In Lisp, you can do much of your planning as
you write the program.

Why wait for hindsight? As Montaigne found, nothing clarifies your ideas
like trying to write them down. Once you're freed from the worry that
you'll paint yourself into a corner, you can take full advantage of this
possibility. The ability to plan programs as you write them has two
momentous consequences: programs take less time to write, because when
you plan and write at the same time, you have a real program to focus
your attention; and they turn out better, because the final design is
always a product of evolution. So long as you maintain a certain
discipline while searching for your program's destiny--so long as you
always rewrite mistaken parts as soon as it becomes clear that they're
mistaken--the final product will be a program more elegant than if you
had spent weeks planning it beforehand.

Lisp's versatility makes this kind of programming a practical
alternative. Indeed, the greatest danger of Lisp is that it may spoil
you. Once you've used Lisp for a while, you may become so sensitive to
the fit between language and application that you won't be able to go
back to another language without always feeling that it doesn't give you
quite the flexibility you need.

<<SEC8>>

** 1.2 Programming Bottom-Up
It's a long-standing principle of programming style that the functional
elements of a program should not be too large. If some component of a
program grows beyond the stage where it's readily comprehensible, it
becomes a mass of complexity which conceals errors as easily as a big
city conceals fugitives. Such software will be hard to read, hard to
test, and hard to debug.

In accordance with this principle, a large program must be divided into
pieces, and the larger the program, the more it must be divided. How do
you divide a program? The traditional approach is called top-down
design: you say "the purpose of the program is to do these seven things,
so I divide it into seven major subroutines. The first subroutine has to
do these four things, so it in turn will have four of its own
subroutines," and so on. This process continues until the whole program
has the right level of granularity--each part large enough to do
something substantial, but small enough to be understood as a single
unit.

Experienced Lisp programmers divide up their programs differently. As
well as top-down design, they follow a principle which could be called
bottom-up design--changing the language to suit the problem. In Lisp,
you don't just write your program down toward the language, you also
build the language up toward your program. As you're writing a program
you may think "I wish Lisp had such-and-such an operator." So you go and
write it. Afterward you realize that using the new operator would
simplify the design of another part of the program, and so on. Language
and program evolve together. Like the border between two warring states,
the boundary between language and program is drawn and redrawn, until
eventually it comes to rest along the mountains and rivers, the natural
frontiers of your problem. In the end your program will look as if the
language had been designed for it. And when language and program fit one
another well, you end up with code which is clear, small, and efficient.

It's worth emphasizing that bottom-up design doesn't mean just writing
the same program in a different order. When you work bottom-up, you
usually end up with a different program. Instead of a single, monolithic
program, you will get a larger language with more abstract operators,
and a smaller program written in it. Instead of a lintel, you'll get an
arch.

In typical code, once you abstract out the parts which are merely
bookkeeping, what's left is much shorter; the higher you build up the
language, the less distance you will have to travel from the top down to
it. This brings several advantages:

- By making the language do more of the work, bottom-up design yields
  programs which are smaller and more agile. A shorter program doesn't
  have to be divided into so many components, and fewer components means
  programs which are easier to read or modify. Fewer components also
  means fewer connections between components, and thus less chance for
  errors there. As industrial designers strive to reduce the number of
  moving parts in a machine, experienced Lisp programmers use bottom-up
  design to reduce the size and complexity of their programs.
- Bottom-up design promotes code re-use. When you write two or more
  programs, many of the utilities you wrote for the first program will
  also be useful in the succeeding ones. Once you've acquired a large
  substrate of utilities, writing a new program can take only a fraction
  of the effort it would require if you had to start with raw Lisp.
- Bottom-up design makes programs easier to read. An instance of this
  type of abstraction asks the reader to understand a general-purpose
  operator; an instance of functional abstraction asks the reader to
  understand a special-purpose subroutine.[fn:1]
- Because it causes you always to be on the lookout for patterns in your
  code, working bottom-up helps to clarify your ideas about the design
  of your program. If two distant components of a program are similar in
  form, you'll be led to notice the similarity and perhaps to redesign
  the program in a simpler way.

Bottom-up design is possible to a certain degree in languages other than
Lisp. Whenever you see library functions, bottom-up design is happening.
However, Lisp gives you much broader powers in this department, and
augmenting the language plays a proportionately larger role in Lisp
style--so much so that Lisp is not just a different language, but a
whole different way of programming.

It's true that this style of development is better suited to programs
which can be written by small groups. However, at the same time, it
extends the limits of what can be done by a small group. In The Mythical
Man-Month, Frederick Brooks proposed that the productivity of a group of
programmers does not grow linearly with its size. As the size of the
group increases, the productivity of individual programmers goes down.
The experience of Lisp programming suggests a more cheerful way to
phrase this law: as the size of the group decreases, the productivity of
individual programmers goes up. A small group wins, relatively speaking,
simply because it's smaller. When a small group also takes advantage of
the techniques that Lisp makes possible, it can win outright.

<<SEC9>>

** 1.3 Extensible Software
The Lisp style of programming is one that has grown in importance as
software has grown in complexity. Sophisticated users now demand so much
from software that we can't possibly anticipate all their needs. They
themselves can't anticipate all their needs. But if we can't give them
software which does everything they want right out of the box, we can
give them software which is extensible. We transform our software from a
mere program into a programming language, and advanced users can build
upon it the extra features that they need.

Bottom-up design leads naturally to extensible programs. The simplest
bottom-up programs consist of two layers: language and program. Complex
programs may be written as a series of layers, each one acting as a
programming language for the one above. If this philosophy is carried
all the way up to the topmost layer, that layer becomes a programming
language for the user. Such a program, where extensibility permeates
every level, is likely to make a much better programming language than a
system which was written as a traditional black box, and then made
extensible as an afterthought.

X Windows and T E X are early examples of programs based on this
principle. In the 1980s better hardware made possible a new generation
of programs which had Lisp as their extension language. The first was
Gnu Emacs, the popular Unix text-editor. Later came Autocad, the first
large-scale commercial product to provide Lisp as an extension language.
In 1991 Interleaf released a new version of its software that not only
had Lisp as an extension language, but was largely implemented in Lisp.

Lisp is an especially good language for writing extensible programs
because it is itself an extensible program. If you write your Lisp
programs so as to pass this extensibility on to the user, you
effectively get an extension language for free. And the difference
between extending a Lisp program in Lisp, and doing the same thing in a
traditional language, is like the difference between meeting someone in
person and conversing by letters. In a program which is made extensible
simply by providing access to outside programs, the best we can hope for
is two black boxes communicating with one another through some
predefined channel. In Lisp, extensions can have direct access to the
entire underlying program. This is not to say that you have to give
users access to every part of your program--just that you now have a
choice about whether to give them access or not.

When this degree of access is combined with an interactive environment,
you have extensibility at its best. Any program that you might use as a
foundation for extensions of your own is likely to be fairly big--too
big, probably, for you to have a complete mental picture of it. What
happens when you're unsure of something? If the original program is
written in Lisp, you can probe it interactively: you can inspect its
data structures; you can call its functions; you may even be able to
look at the original source code. This kind of feedback allows you to
program with a high degree of confidence--to write more ambitious
extensions, and to write them faster. An interactive environment always
makes programming easier, but it is nowhere more valuable than when one
is writing extensions.

An extensible program is a double-edged sword, but recent experience has
shown that users prefer a double-edged sword to a blunt one. Extensible
programs seem to prevail, whatever their inherent dangers.

** 1.4 Extending Lisp
There are two ways to add new operators to Lisp: functions and macros.
In Lisp, functions you define have the same status as the built-in ones.
If you want a new variant of mapcar, you can define one yourself and use
it just as you would use mapcar. For example, if you want a list of the
values returned by some function when it is applied to all the integers
from 1 to 10, you could create a new list and pass it to mapcar:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mapcar fn
        (do* ((x 1 (1+ x))
              (result (list x) (push x result)))
            ((= x 10) (nreverse result))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

but this approach is both ugly and
inefficient.[fn:2] Instead you could define a new mapping
function map1-n (see page 54), and then call it as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (map1-n fn 10)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Defining functions is comparatively straightforward. Macros provide a
more general, but less well-understood, means of defining new operators.
Macros are programs that write programs. This statement has far-reaching
implications, and exploring them is one of the main purposes of this
book.

The thoughtful use of macros leads to programs which are marvels of
clarity and elegance. These gems are not to be had for nothing.
Eventually macros will seem the most natural thing in the world, but
they can be hard to understand at first. Partly this is because they are
more general than functions, so there is more to keep in mind when
writing them. But the main reason macros are hard to understand is that
they're foreign. No other language has anything like Lisp macros. Thus
learning about macros may entail unlearning preconceptions inadvertently
picked up from other languages. Foremost among these is the notion of a
program as something afflicted by rigor mortis. Why should data
structures be fluid and changeable, but programs not? In Lisp, programs
are data, but the implications of this fact take a while to sink in.

If it takes some time to get used to macros, it is well worth the
effort. Even in such mundane uses as iteration, macros can make programs
significantly smaller and cleaner. Suppose a program must iterate over
some body of code for x from a to b. The built-in Lisp do is meant for
more general cases. For simple iteration it does not yield the most
readable code:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (do ((x a (+ 1 x)))
        ((> x b))
      (print x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Instead, suppose we could just say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (for (x a b)
         (print x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Macros make this possible. With six lines of code (see page 154) we can
add for to the language, just as if it had been there from the start.
And as later chapters will show, writing for is only the beginning of
what you can do with macros.

You're not limited to extending Lisp one function or macro at a time. If
you need to, you can build a whole language on top of Lisp, and write
your programs in that. Lisp is an excellent language for writing
compilers and interpreters, but it offers another way of defining a new
language which is often more elegant and certainly much less work: to
define the new language as a modification of Lisp. Then the parts of
Lisp which can appear unchanged in the new language (e.g. arithmetic or
I/O) can be used as is, and you only have to implement the parts which
are different (e.g. control structure). A language implemented in this
way is called an embedded language.

Embedded languages are a natural outgrowth of bottom-up programming.
Common Lisp includes several already. The most famous of them, CLOS, is
discussed in the last chapter. But you can define embedded languages of
your own, too. You can have the language which suits your program, even
if it ends up looking quite different from Lisp.

** 1.5 Why Lisp (or When)
These new possibilities do not stem from a single magic ingredient. In
this respect, Lisp is like an arch. Which of the wedge-shaped stones
(voussoirs) is the one that holds up the arch? The question itself is
mistaken; they all do. Like an arch, Lisp is a collection of
interlocking features. We can list some of these features--- dynamic
storage allocation and garbage collection, runtime typing, functions as
objects, a built-in parser which generates lists, a compiler which
accepts programs expressed as lists, an interactive environment, and so
on--but the power of Lisp cannot be traced to any single one of them. It
is the combination which makes Lisp programming what it is.

Over the past twenty years, the way people program has changed. Many of
these changes--interactive environments, dynamic linking, even
object-oriented programming--have been piecemeal attempts to give other
languages some of the flexibility of Lisp. The metaphor of the arch
suggests how well they have succeeded.

It is widely known that Lisp and Fortran are the two oldest languages
still in use. What is perhaps more significant is that they represent
opposite poles in the philosophy of language design. Fortran was
invented as a step up from assembly language. Lisp was invented as a
language for expressing algorithms. Such different intentions yielded
vastly different languages. Fortran makes life easy for the compiler
writer; Lisp makes life easy for the programmer. Most programming
languages since have fallen somewhere between the two poles. Fortran and
Lisp have themselves moved closer to the center. Fortran now looks more
like Algol, and Lisp has given up some of the wasteful habits of its
youth.

The original Fortran and Lisp defined a sort of battlefield. On one side
the battle cry is "Efficiency! (And besides, it would be too hard to
implement.)" On the other side, the battle cry is "Abstraction! (And
anyway, this isn't production software.)" As the gods determined from
afar the outcomes of battles among the ancient Greeks, the outcome of
this battle is being determined by hardware. Every year, things look
better for Lisp. The arguments against Lisp are now starting to sound
very much like the arguments that assembly language programmers gave
against high-level languages in the early 1970s. The question is now
becoming not Why Lisp?, but When?

* 2. Functions
Functions are the building-blocks of Lisp programs. They are also the
building-blocks of Lisp. In most languages the + operator is something
quite different from user-defined functions. But Lisp has a single
model, function application, to describe all the computation done by a
program. The Lisp + operator is a function, just like the ones you can
define yourself.

In fact, except for a small number of operators called special forms,
the core of Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions. What's to stop you
from adding to this collection? Nothing at all: if you think of
something you wish Lisp could do, you can write it yourself, and your
new function will be treated just like the built-in ones.

This fact has important consequences for the programmer. It means that
any new function could be considered either as an addition to Lisp, or
as part of a specific application. Typically, an experienced Lisp
programmer will write some of each, adjusting the boundary between
language and application until the two fit one another perfectly. This
book is about how to achieve a good fit between language and
application. Since everything we do toward this end ultimately depends
on functions, functions are the natural place to begin.

** 2.1 Functions as Data
Two things make Lisp functions different. One, mentioned above, is that
Lisp itself is a collection of functions. This means that we can add to
Lisp new operators of our own. Another important thing to know about
functions is that they are Lisp objects.

Lisp offers most of the data types one finds in other languages. We get
integers and floating-point numbers, strings, arrays, structures, and so
on. But Lisp supports one data type which may at first seem surprising:
the function. Nearly all programming languages provide some form of
function or procedure. What does it mean to say that Lisp provides them
as a data type? It means that in Lisp we can do with functions all the
things we expect to do with more familiar data types, like integers:
create new ones at runtime, store them in variables and in structures,
pass them as arguments to other functions, and return them as results.

The ability to create and return functions at runtime is particularly
useful. This might sound at first like a dubious sort of advantage, like
the self-modifying machine language programs one can run on some
computers. But creating new functions at runtime turns out to be a
routinely used Lisp programming technique.

** 2.2 Defining Functions
Most people first learn how to make functions with defun. The following
expression defines a function called double which returns twice its
argument.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (defun double (x) (* x 2))
    DOUBLE
#+END_EXAMPLE

Having fed this to Lisp, we can call double in other functions, or from
the toplevel:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (double 1)
    2
#+END_EXAMPLE

A file of Lisp code usually consists mainly of such defuns, and so
resembles a file of procedure definitions in a language like C or
Pascal. But something quite different is going on. Those defuns are not
just procedure definitions, they're Lisp calls. This distinction will
become clearer when we see what's going on underneath defun.

Functions are objects in their own right. What defun really does is
build one, and store it under the name given as the first argument. So
as well as calling double, we can get hold of the function which
implements it. The usual way to do so is by using the #' (sharp-quote)
operator. This operator can be understood as mapping names to actual
function objects. By affixing it to the name of double

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > #'double
    #<Interpreted-Function C66ACE>
#+END_EXAMPLE

we get the actual object created by the definition above. Though its
printed representation will vary from implementation to implementation,
a Common Lisp function is a first-class object, with all the same rights
as more familiar objects like numbers and strings. So we can pass this
function as an argument, return it, store it in a data structure, and so
on:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (eq #'double (car (list #'double)))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

We don't even need defun to make functions. Like most Lisp objects, we
can refer to them literally. When we want to refer to an integer, we
just use the integer itself. To represent a string, we use a series of
characters surrounded by double-quotes. To represent a function, we use
what's called a lambda-expression. A lambda-expression is a list with
three parts: the symbol lambda, a parameter list, and a body of zero or
more expressions. This lambda-expression refers to a function equivalent
to double:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (lambda (x) (* x 2))
#+END_EXAMPLE

It describes a function which takes one argument x, and returns 2x.

A lambda-expression can also be considered as the name of a function. If
double is a proper name, like "Michelangelo," then (lambda (x) (* x 2))
is a definite description, like "the man who painted the ceiling of the
Sistine Chapel." By putting a sharp-quote before a lambda-expression, we
get the corresponding function:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > #'(lambda (x) (* x 2))
    #<Interpreted-Function C674CE>
#+END_EXAMPLE

This function behaves exactly like double, but the two are distinct
objects.

In a function call, the name of the function appears first, followed by
the arguments:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (double 3)
    6
#+END_EXAMPLE

Since lambda-expressions are also names of functions, they can also
appear first in function calls:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > ((lambda (x) (* x 2)) 3)
    6
#+END_EXAMPLE

In Common Lisp, we can have a function named double and a variable named
double at the same time.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq double 2)
    2
    > (double double)
    4
#+END_EXAMPLE

When a name occurs first in a function call, or is preceded by a
sharp-quote, it is taken to refer to a function. Otherwise it is treated
as a variable name.

It is therefore said that Common Lisp has distinct name-spaces for
variables and functions. We can have a variable called foo and a
function called foo, and they need not be identical. This situation can
be confusing, and leads to a certain amount of ugliness in code, but it
is something that Common Lisp programmers have to live with.

If necessary, Common Lisp provides two functions which map symbols to
the values, or functions, that they represent. The function symbol-value
takes a symbol and returns the value of the corresponding special
variable:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (symbol-value 'double)
    2
#+END_EXAMPLE

while symbol-function does the same for a globally defined function:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (symbol-function 'double)
    #<Interpreted-Function C66ACE>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that, since functions are ordinary data objects, a variable could
have a function as its value:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq x #'append)
    #<Compiled-Function 46B4BE>
    > (eq (symbol-value 'x) (symbol-function 'append))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

Beneath the surface, defun is setting the symbol-function of its first
argument to a function constructed from the remaining arguments. The
following two expressions do approximately the same thing:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun double (x) (* x 2))

    (setf (symbol-function 'double)
          #'(lambda (x) (* x 2)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

So defun has the same effect as procedure definition in other
languages--to associate a name with a piece of code. But the underlying
mechanism is not the same. We don't need defun to make functions, and
functions don't have to be stored away as the value of some symbol.
Underlying defun, which resembles procedure definition in any other
language, is a more general mechanism: building a function and
associating it with a certain name are two separate operations. When we
don't need the full generality of Lisp's notion of a function, defun
makes function definition as simple as in more restrictive languages.

** 2.3 Functional Arguments

   :END:

Having functions as data objects means, among other things, that we can
pass them as arguments to other functions. This possibility is partly
responsible for the importance of bottom-up programming in Lisp.

A language which allows functions as data objects must also provide some
way of calling them. In Lisp, this function is apply. Generally, we call
apply with two arguments: a function, and a list of arguments for it.
The following four expressions all have the same effect:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (+ 1 2)
    (apply #'+ '(1 2))
    (apply (symbol-function '+) '(1 2))
    (apply #'(lambda (x y) (+ x y)) '(1 2))
#+END_EXAMPLE

In Common Lisp, apply can take any number of arguments, and the function
given first will be applied to the list made by consing the rest of the
arguments onto the list given last. So the expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (apply #'+ 1 '(2))
#+END_EXAMPLE

is equivalent to the preceding four. If it is inconvenient to give the
arguments as a list, we can use funcall, which differs from apply only
in this respect. This expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (funcall #'+ 1 2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

has the same effect as those above.

Many built-in Common Lisp functions take functional arguments. Among the
most frequently used are the mapping functions. For example, mapcar
takes two or more arguments, a function and one or more lists (one for
each parameter of the function), and applies the function successively
to elements of each list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (+ x 10))
    '(1 2 3))
    (11 12 13)
    > (mapcar #'+
    '(1 2 3)
    '(10 100 1000))
    (11 102 1003)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Lisp programs frequently want to do something to each element of a list
and get back a list of results. The first example above illustrates the
conventional way to do this: make a function which does what you want
done, and mapcar it over the list.

Already we see how convenient it is to be able to treat functions as
data. In many languages, even if we could pass a function as an argument
to something like mapcar, it would still have to be a function defined
in some source file beforehand. If just one piece of code wanted to add
10 to each element of a list, we would have to define a function, called
plus ten or some such, just for this one use. With lambda-expressions,
we can refer to functions directly.

One of the big differences between Common Lisp and the dialects which
preceded it are the large number of built-in functions that take
functional arguments. Two of the most commonly used, after the
ubiquitous mapcar, are sort and remove-if. The former is a
general-purpose sorting function. It takes a list and a predicate, and
returns a list sorted by passing each pair of elements to the predicate.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (sort '(1 4 2 5 6 7 3) #'<)
    (1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
#+END_EXAMPLE

To remember how sort works, it helps to remember that if you sort a list
with no duplicates by <, and then apply < to the resulting list, it will
return true.

If remove-if weren't included in Common Lisp, it might be the first
utility you would write. It takes a function and a list, and returns all
the elements of the list for which the function returns false.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (remove-if #'evenp '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7))
    (1 3 5 7)
#+END_EXAMPLE

As an example of a function which takes functional arguments, here is a
definition of a limited version of remove-if:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-remove-if (fn lst)
      (if (null lst)
          nil
        (if (funcall fn (car lst))
        (our-remove-if fn (cdr lst))
          (cons (car lst) (our-remove-if fn (cdr lst))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that within this definition fn is not sharp-quoted. Since functions
are data objects, a variable can have a function as its regular value.
That's what's happening here. Sharp-quote is only for referring to the
function named by a symbol--usually one globally defined as such with
defun.

As Chapter 4 will show, writing new utilities which take functional
arguments is an important element of bottom-up programming. Common Lisp
has so many utilities built-in that the one you need may exist already.
But whether you use built-ins like sort, or write your own utilities,
the principle is the same. Instead of wiring in functionality, pass a
functional argument.

** 2.4 Functions as Properties
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: functions-as-properties

   :END:

The fact that functions are Lisp objects also allows us to write
programs which can be extended to deal with new cases on the fly.
Suppose we want to write a function which takes a type of animal and
behaves appropriately. In most languages, the way to do this would be
with a case statement, and we can do it this way in Lisp as well:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun behave (animal)
      (case animal
        (dog (wag-tail)
         (bark))
        (rat (scurry)
         (squeak))
        (cat (rub-legs)
         (scratch-carpet))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

What if we want to add a new type of animal? If we were planning to add
new animals, it would have been better to define behave as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun behave (animal)
      (funcall (get animal 'behavior)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and to define the behavior of an individual animal as a function stored,
for example, on the property list of its name:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (get 'dog 'behavior)
          #'(lambda ()
          (wag-tail)
          (bark)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This way, all we need do in order to add a new animal is define a new
property. No functions have to be rewritten.

The second approach, though more flexible, looks slower. It is. If speed
were critical, we would use structures instead of property lists and,
especially, compiled instead of interpreted functions. (Section 2.9
explains how to make these.) With structures and compiled functions, the
more flexible type of code can approach or exceed the speed of versions
using case statements.

This use of functions corresponds to the concept of a method in
object-oriented programming. Generally speaking, a method is a function
which is a property of an object, and that's just what we have. If we
add inheritance to this model, we'll have all the elements of
object-oriented programming. Chapter 25 will show that this can be done
with surprisingly little code.

One of the big selling points of object-oriented programming is that it
makes programs extensible. This prospect excites less wonder in the Lisp
world, where extensibility has always been taken for granted. If the
kind of extensibility we need does not depend too much on inheritance,
then plain Lisp may already be sufficient.

<<SEC17>>

** 2.5 Scope
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: scope
   :style: color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;
   :END:

Common Lisp is a lexically scoped Lisp. Scheme is the oldest dialect
with lexical scope; before Scheme, dynamic scope was considered one of
the defining features of Lisp.

The difference between lexical and dynamic scope comes down to how an
implementation deals with free variables. A symbol is bound in an
expression if it has been established as a variable, either by appearing
as a parameter, or by variable-binding operators like let and do.
Symbols which are not bound are said to be free. In this example, scope
comes into play:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((y 7))
      (defun scope-test (x)
        (list x y)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Within the defun expression,x is bound and y is free. Free variables are
interesting because it's not obvious what their values should be.
There's no uncertainty about the value of a bound variable--when
scope-test is called, the value of x should be whatever is passed as the
argument. But what should be the value of y? This is the question
answered by the dialect's scope rules.

In a dynamically scoped Lisp, to find the value of a free variable when
executing scope-test, we look back through the chain of functions that
called it. When we find an environment where y was bound, that binding
of y will be the one used in scope-test. If we find none, we take the
global value of y. Thus, in a dynamically scoped Lisp, y would have the
value it had in the calling expression:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((y 5))
    (scope-test 3))
    (3 5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

With dynamic scope, it means nothing that y was bound to 7 when
scope-test was defined. All that matters is that y had a value of 5 when
scope-test was called.

In a lexically scoped Lisp, instead of looking back through the chain of
calling functions, we look back through the containing environments at
the time the function was defined. In a lexically scoped Lisp, our
example would catch the binding of y where scope-test was defined. So
this is what would happen in Common Lisp:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((y 5))
    (scope-test 3))
    (3 7)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here the binding of y to 5 at the time of the call has no effect on the
returned value.

Though you can still get dynamic scope by declaring a variable to be
special, lexical scope is the default in Common Lisp. On the whole, the
Lisp community seems to view the passing of dynamic scope with little
regret. For one thing, it used to lead to horribly elusive bugs. But
lexical scope is more than a way of avoiding bugs. As the next section
will show, it also makes possible some new programming techniques.

<<SEC18>>

** 2.6 Closures
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: closures
   :style: color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;
   :END:

Because Common Lisp is lexically scoped, when we define a function
containing free variables, the system must save copies of the bindings
of those variables at the time the function was defined. Such a
combination of a function and a set of variable bindings is called a
closure. Closures turn out to be useful in a wide variety of
applications.

Closures are so pervasive in Common Lisp programs that it's possible to
use them without even knowing it. Every time you give mapcar a
sharp-quoted lambda-expression containing free variables, you're using
closures. For example, suppose we want to write a function which takes a
list of numbers and adds a certain amount to each one. The function
list+

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun list+ (lst n)
      (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (+ x n))
          lst))
#+END_EXAMPLE

will do what we want:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (list+ '(1 2 3) 10)
    (11 12 13)
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we look closely at the function which is passed to mapcar within
list+, it's actually a closure. The instance of n is free, and its
binding comes from the surrounding environment. Under lexical scope,
every such use of a mapping function causes the creation of a
closure.[fn:3]

Closures play a more conspicuous role in a style of programming promoted
by Abelson and Sussman's classic Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs. Closures are functions with local state. The simplest
way to use this state is in a situation like the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((counter 0))
      (defun new-id () (incf counter))
      (defun reset-id () (setq counter 0)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

These two functions share a variable which serves as a counter. The
first one returns successive values of the counter, and the second
resets the counter to 0. The same thing could be done by making the
counter a global variable, but this way it is protected from unintended
references.

It's also useful to be able to return functions with local state. For
example, the function make-adder

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun make-adder (n)
      #'(lambda (x) (+ x n)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

takes a number, and returns a closure which, when called, adds that
number to its argument. We can make as many instances of adders as we
want:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq add2 (make-adder 2)
    add10 (make-adder 10))
    #<Interpreted-Function BF162E>
    > (funcall add2 5)
    7
    > (funcall add10 3)
    13
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the closures returned by make-adder, the internal state is fixed, but
it's also possible to make closures which can be asked to change their
state.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun make-adderb (n)
      #'(lambda (x &optional change)
          (if change
          (setq n x)
        (+ x n))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This new version of make-adder returns closures which, when called with
one argument, behave just like the old ones.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq addx (make-adderb 1))
    #<Interpreted-Function BF1C66>
    > (funcall addx 3)
    4
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, when the new type of adder is called with a non-nil second
argument, its internal copy of n will be reset to the value passed as
the first argument:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (funcall addx 100 t)
    100
    > (funcall addx 3)
    103
#+END_EXAMPLE

It's even possible to return a group of closures which share the same
data objects. Figure 2.1 contains a function which creates primitive
databases. It takes an assoc-list (db), and returns a list of three
closures which query, add, and delete entries, respectively.

Each call to make-dbms makes a new database--a new set of functions
closed over their own shared copy of an assoc-list.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq cities (make-dbms '((boston . us) (paris . france))))
    (#<Interpreted-Function 8022E7>
    #<Interpreted-Function 802317>
    #<Interpreted-Function 802347>)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun make-dbms (db)
      (list
       #'(lambda (key)
           (cdr (assoc key db)))
       #'(lambda (key val)
           (push (cons key val) db)
           key)
       #'(lambda (key)
           (setf db (delete key db :key #'car))
           key)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 2.1: Three closures share a list.

<<IDX1>>

The actual assoc-list within the database is invisible from the outside
world--we can't even tell that it's an assoc-list--but it can be reached
through the functions which are components of cities:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (funcall (car cities) 'boston)
    US
    > (funcall (second cities) 'london 'england)
    LONDON
    > (funcall (car cities) 'london)
    ENGLAND
#+END_EXAMPLE

Calling the car of a list is a bit ugly. In real programs, the access
functions might instead be entries in a structure. Using them could also
be cleaner--databases could be reached indirectly via functions like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun lookup (key db)
      (funcall (car db) key))
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, the basic behavior of closures is independent of such
refinements.

In real programs, the closures and data structures would also be more
elaborate than those we see in make-adderor make-dbms. The single shared
variable could be any number of variables, each bound to any sort of
data structure.

Closures are one of the distinct, tangible benefits of Lisp. Some Lisp
programs could, with effort, be translated into less powerful languages.
But just try to translate a program which uses closures as above, and it
will become evident how much work this abstraction is saving us. Later
chapters will deal with closures in more detail. Chapter 5 shows how to
use them to build compound functions, and Chapter 6 looks at their use
as a substitute for traditional data structures.

When we define functions with lambda-expressions, we face a restriction
which doesn't arise with defun: a function defined in a
lambda-expression doesn't have a name and therefore has no way of
referring to itself. This means that in Common Lisp we can't use lambda
to define a recursive function.

If we want to apply some function to all the elements of a list, we use
the most familiar of Lisp idioms:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (+ 2 x))
    '(2 5 7 3))
    (4 7 9 5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

What about cases where we want to give a recursive function as the first
argument to mapcar? If the function has been defined with defun, we can
simply refer to it by name:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapcar #'copy-tree '((a b) (c d e)))
    ((A B) (C D E))
#+END_EXAMPLE

But now suppose that the function has to be a closure, taking some
bindings from the environment in which the mapcar occurs. In our example
list+,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun list+ (lst n)
      (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (+ x n))
          lst))
#+END_EXAMPLE

the first argument to mapcar,#'(lambda (x) (+ x n)), must be defined
within list+ because it needs to catch the binding of n. So far so good,
but what if we want to give mapcar a function which both needs local
bindings and is recursive? We can't use a function defined elsewhere
with defun, because we need bindings from the local environment. And we
can't use lambda to define a recursive function, because the function
will have no way of referring to itself.

Common Lisp gives us labels as a way out of this dilemma. With one
important reservation, labels could be described as a sort of let for
functions. Each of the binding specifications in a labels expression
should have the form

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (#name# #parameters# . #body#)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Within the labels expression, #name# will refer to a function equivalent
to:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #'(lambda #parameters# . #body#)
#+END_EXAMPLE

So for example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (labels ((inc (x) (1+ x)))
    (inc 3))
    4
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, there is an important difference between let and labels. In a
let expression, the value of one variable can't depend on another
variable made by the same let--that is, you can't say

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x 10) (y x))
      y)
#+END_EXAMPLE

and expect the value of the newy to reflect that of the newx. In
contrast, the body of a function f defined in a labels expression may
refer to any other function defined there, including f itself, which
makes recursive function definitions possible.

Using labels we can write a function analogous to list+, but in which
the first argument to mapcar is a recursive function:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun count-instances (obj lsts)
      (labels ((instances-in (lst)
                 (if (consp lst)
                     (+ (if (eq (car lst) obj) 1 0)
                    (instances-in (cdr lst)))
                   0)))
        (mapcar #'instances-in lsts)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This function takes an object and a list, and returns a list of the
number of occurrences of the object in each element:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (count-instances 'a '((a b c) (d a r p a) (d a r) (a a)))
    (1 2 1 2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** 2.8 Tail-Recursion
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: tail-recursion
   :style: color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;
   :END:

A recursive function is one that calls itself. Such a call is
tail-recursive if no work remains to be done in the calling function
afterwards. This function is not tail-recursive

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-length (lst)
      (if (null lst)
          0
        (1+ (our-length (cdr lst)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

because on returning from the recursive call we have to pass the result
to 1+. The following function is tail-recursive, though

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-find-if (fn lst)
      (if (funcall fn (car lst))
          (car lst)
        (our-find-if fn (cdr lst))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

because the value of the recursive call is immediately returned.

Tail-recursion is desirable because many Common Lisp compilers can
transform tail-recursive functions into loops. With such a compiler, you
can have the elegance of recursion in your source code without the
overhead of function calls at runtime. The gain in speed is usually
great enough that programmers go out of their way to make functions
tail-recursive.

A function which isn't tail-recursive can often be transformed into one
that is by embedding in it a local function which uses an accumulator.
In this context, an accumulator is a parameter representing the value
computed so far. For example, our-length could be transformed into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-length (lst)
      (labels ((rec (lst acc)
            (if (null lst)
                acc
              (rec (cdr lst) (1+ acc)))))
        (rec lst 0)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

where the number of list elements seen so far is contained in a second
parameter, acc. When the recursion reaches the end of the list, the
value of acc will be the total length, which can just be returned. By
accumulating the value as we go down the calling tree instead of
constructing it on the way back up, we can make rec tail-recursive.

Many Common Lisp compilers can do tail-recursion optimization, but not
all of them do it by default. So after writing your functions to be
tail-recursive, you may also want to put

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (proclaim '(optimize speed))
#+END_EXAMPLE

at the top of the file, to ensure that the compiler can take advantage
of your efforts.[fn:4]

Given tail-recursion and type declarations, existing Common Lisp
compilers can generate code that runs as fast as, or faster than, C.
Richard Gabriel gives as an example the following function, which
returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun triangle (n)
      (labels ((tri (c n)
            (declare (type fixnum n c))
            (if (zerop n)
                c
              (tri (the fixnum (+ n c))
                   (the fixnum (- n 1))))))
        (tri 0 n)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is what fast Common Lisp code looks like. At first it may not seem
natural to write functions this way. It's often a good idea to begin by
writing a function in whatever way seems most natural, and then, if
necessary, transforming it into a tail-recursive equivalent.

** 2.9 Compilation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: compilation
   :style: color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;
   :END:

Lisp functions can be compiled either individually or by the file. If
you just type a defun expression into the toplevel,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (defun foo (x) (1+ x))
    FOO
#+END_EXAMPLE

many implementations will create an interpreted function. You can check
whether a given function is compiled by feeding it to
compiled-function-p:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (compiled-function-p #'foo)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can have foo compiled by giving its name to compile

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (compile 'foo)
    FOO
#+END_EXAMPLE

which will compile the definition of foo and replace the interpreted
version with a compiled one.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (compiled-function-p #'foo)
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

Compiled and interpreted functions are both Lisp objects, and behave the
same, except with respect to compiled-function-p. Literal functions can
also be compiled: compile expects its first argument to be a name, but
if you give nil as the first argument, it will compile the
lambda-expression given as the second argument.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (compile nil '(lambda (x) (+ x 2)))
    #<Compiled-Function BF55BE>
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you give both the name and function arguments, compile becomes a sort
of compiling defun:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (progn (compile 'bar '(lambda (x) (* x 3)))
    (compiled-function-p #'bar))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

Having compile in the language means that a programcould build and
compile new functions on the fly. However, calling compile explicitly is
a drastic measure, comparable to calling eval, and should be viewed with
the same suspicion.[fn:5] When Section 2.1 said that
creating new functions at runtime was a routinely used programming
technique, it referred to new closures like those made by make-adder,
not functions made by calling compile on raw lists. Calling compile is
not a routinely used programming technique--it's an extremely rare one.
So beware of doing it unnecessarily. Unless you're implementing another
language on top of Lisp (and much of the time, even then), what you need
to do may be possible with macros.

There are two sorts of functions which you can't give as an argument to
compile. According to CLTL2 (p. 677), you can't compile a function
"defined interpretively in a non-null lexical environment." That is, if
at the toplevel you define foo within a let

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((y 2))
    (defun foo (x) (+ x y)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then (compile 'foo) will not necessarily work.[fn:6] You
also can't call compile on a function which is already compiled. In this
situation, CLTL2 hints darkly that "the consequences. . .are
unspecified."

The usual way to compile Lisp code is not to compile functions
individually with compile, but to compile whole files with compile-file.
This function takes a filename and creates a compiled version of the
source file--typically with the same base name but a different
extension. When the compiled file is loaded, compiled-function-pshould
return true for all the functions defined in the file.

Later chapters will depend on another effect of compilation: when one
function occurs within another function, and the containing function is
compiled, the inner function will also get compiled. CLTL2 does not seem
to say explicitly that this will happen, but in a decent implementation
you can count on it.

The compiling of inner functions becomes evident in functions which
return functions. When make-adder (page 18) is compiled, it will return
compiled functions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (compile 'make-adder)
    MAKE-ADDER
    > (compiled-function-p (make-adder 2))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

As later chapters will show, this fact is of great importance in the
implementation of embedded languages. If a new language is implemented
by transformation, and the transformation code is compiled, then it
yields compiled output--and so becomes in effect a compiler for the new
language. (A simple example is described on page 81.)

If we have a particularly small function, we may want to request that it
be compiled inline. Otherwise, the machinery of calling it could entail
more effort than the function itself. If we define a function:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun 50th (lst) (nth 49 lst))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and make the declaration:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (proclaim '(inline 50th))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then a reference to 50th within a compiled function should no longer
require a real function call. If we define and compile a function which
calls 50th,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun foo (lst)
      (+ (50th lst) 1))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then when foo is compiled, the code for 50th should be compiled right
into it, just as if we had written

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun foo (lst)
      (+ (nth 49 lst) 1))
#+END_EXAMPLE

in the first place. The drawback is that if we redefine 50th, we also
have to recompile foo, or it will still reflect the old definition. The
restrictions on inline functions are basically the same as those on
macros (see Section 7.9).

In some earlier dialects of Lisp, functions were represented as lists.
This gave Lisp programs the remarkable ability to write and execute
their own Lisp programs. In Common Lisp, functions are no longer made of
lists--good implementations compile them into native machine code. But
you can still write programs that write programs, because lists are the
input to the compiler.

It cannot be overemphasized how important it is that Lisp programs can
write Lisp programs, especially since this fact is so often overlooked.
Even experienced Lisp users rarely realize the advantages they derive
from this feature of the language. This is why Lisp macros are so
powerful, for example. Most of the techniques described in this book
depend on the ability to write programs which manipulate Lisp
expressions.

<<SEC23>>

* 3. Functional Programming
The previous chapter explained how Lisp and Lisp programs are both built
out of a single raw material: the function. Like any building material,
its qualities influence both the kinds of things we build, and the way
we build them.

This chapter describes the kind of construction methods which prevail in
the Lisp world. The sophistication of these methods allows us to attempt
more ambitious kinds of programs. The next chapter will describe one
particularly important class of programs which become possible in Lisp:
programs which evolve instead of being developed by the old
plan-and-implement method.

** 3.1 Functional Design
The character of an object is influenced by the elements from which it
is made. A wooden building looks different from a stone one, for
example. Even when you are too far away to see wood or stone, you can
tell from the overall shape of the building what it's made of. The
character of Lisp functions has a similar influence on the structure of
Lisp programs.

Functional programming means writing programs which work by returning
values instead of by performing side-effects. Side-effects include
destructive changes to objects (e.g. by rplaca) and assignments to
variables (e.g. by setq). If side-effects are few and localized,
programs become easier to read, test, and debug. Lisp programs have not
always been written in this style, but over time Lisp and functional
programming have gradually become inseparable.

An example will show how functional programming differs from what you
might do in another language. Suppose for some reason we want the
elements of a list in the reverse order. Instead of writing a function
to reverse lists, we write a function which takes a list, and returns a
list with the same elements in the reverse order.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun bad-reverse (lst)
      (let* ((len (length lst))
         (ilimit (truncate (/ len 2))))
        (do ((i 0 (1+ i))
         (j (1- len) (1- j)))
        ((>= i ilimit))
          (rotatef (nth i lst) (nth j lst)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 3.1: A function to reverse lists.

<<IDX2>>

Figure 3.1 contains a function to reverse lists. It treats the list as
an array, reversing it in place; its return value is irrelevant:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq lst '(a b c))
    (A B C)
    > (bad-reverse lst)
    NIL
    > lst
    (C B A)
#+END_EXAMPLE

As its name suggests, bad-reverse is far from good Lisp style. Moreover,
its ugliness is contagious: because it works by side-effects, it will
also draw its callers away from the functional ideal.

Though cast in the role of the villain, bad-reverse does have one merit:
it shows the Common Lisp idiom for swapping two values. The rotatef
macro rotates the values of any number of generalized variables--that
is, expressions you could give as the first argument to setf. When
applied to just two arguments, the effect is to swap them.

In contrast, Figure 3.2 shows a function which returns reversed lists.
With good-reverse, we get the reversed list as the return value; the
original list is not touched.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq lst '(a b c))
    (A B C)
    > (good-reverse lst)
    (C B A)
    > lst
    (A B C)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun good-reverse (lst)
      (labels ((rev (lst acc)
            (if (null lst)
                acc
              (rev (cdr lst) (cons (car lst) acc)))))
        (rev lst nil)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 3.2: A function to return reversed lists.

<<IDX3>>

It used to be thought that you could judge someone's character by
looking at the shape of his head. Whether or not this is true of people,
it is generally true of Lisp programs. Functional programs have a
different shape from imperative ones. The structure in a functional
program comes entirely from the composition of arguments within
expressions, and since arguments are indented, functional code will show
more variation in indentation. Functional code looks
fluid[fn:7] on the page; imperative code looks solid and
blockish, like Basic.

Even from a distance, the shapes of bad- and good-reverse suggest which
is the better program. And despite being shorter, good-reverse is also
more efficient: O(n) instead of O(n 2 ).

We are spared the trouble of writing reverse because Common Lisp has it
built-in. It is worth looking briefly at this function, because it is
one that often brings to the surface misconceptions about functional
programming. Like good-reverse,the built-in reverseworks by returning a
value--it doesn't touch its arguments. But people learning Lisp may
assume that, like bad-reverse, it works by side-effects. If in some part
of a program they want a list lst to be reversed, they may write

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (reverse lst)
#+END_EXAMPLE

and wonder why the call seems to have no effect. In fact, if we want
effects from such a function, we have to see to it ourselves in the
calling code. That is, we need to write

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq lst (reverse lst))
#+END_EXAMPLE

instead. Operators like reverse are intended to be called for return
values, not side-effects. It is worth writing your own programs in this
style too--not only for its inherent benefits, but because, if you
don't, you will be working against the language.

One of the points we ignored in the comparison of bad- and good-reverse
is that bad-reverse doesn't cons. Instead of building new list
structure, it operates on the original list. This can be dangerous--the
list could be needed elsewhere in the program--but for efficiency it is
sometimes necessary. For such cases, Common Lisp provides an O(n)
destructive reversing function called nreverse.

A destructive function is one that can alter the arguments passed to it.
However, even destructive functions usually work by returning values:
you have to assume that nreverse will recycle lists you give to it as
arguments, but you still can't assume that it will reverse them. As
before, the reversed list has to be found in the return value. You still
can't write

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (nreverse lst)
#+END_EXAMPLE

in the middle of a function and assume that afterwards lst will be
reversed. This is what happens in most implementations:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq lst '(a b c))
    (A B C)
    > (nreverse lst)
    (C B A)
    > lst
    (A)
#+END_EXAMPLE

To reverse lst, you have would have to set lst to the return value, as
with plain reverse.

If a function is advertised as destructive, that doesn't mean that it's
meant to be called for side-effects. The danger is, some destructive
functions give the impression that they are. For example,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (nconc x y)
#+END_EXAMPLE

almost always has the same effect as

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq x (nconc x y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you wrote code which relied on the former idiom, it might seem to
work for some time. However, it wouldn't do what you expected when x was
nil.

Only a few Lisp operators are intended to be called for side-effects. In
general, the built-in operators are meant to be called for their return
values. Don't be misled by names like sort, remove, or substitute. If
you want side-effects, use setq on the return value.

This very rule suggests that some side-effects are inevitable. Having
functional programming as an ideal doesn't imply that programs should
never have side-effects. It just means that they should have no more
than necessary.

It may take time to develop this habit. One way to start is to treat the
following operators as if there were a tax on their use:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    set setq setf psetf psetq incf decf push pop pushnew
    rplaca rplacd rotatef shiftf remf remprop remhash
#+END_EXAMPLE

and also let*, in which imperative programs often lie concealed.
Treating these operators as taxable is only proposed as a help toward,
not a criterion for, good Lisp style. However, this alone can get you
surprisingly far.

In other languages, one of the most common causes of side-effects is the
need for a function to return multiple values. If functions can only
return one value, they have to "return" the rest by altering their
parameters. Fortunately, this isn't necessary in Common Lisp, because
any function can return multiple values.

The built-in function truncate returns two values, for example--the
truncated integer, and what was cut off in order to create it. A typical
implementation will print both when truncate is called at the toplevel:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (truncate 26.21875)
    26
    0.21875
#+END_EXAMPLE

When the calling code only wants one value, the first one is used:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (= (truncate 26.21875) 26)
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

The calling code can catch both return values by using a
multiple-value-bind. This operator takes a list of variables, a call,
and a body of code. The body is evaluated with the variables bound to
the respective return values from the call:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (multiple-value-bind (int frac) (truncate 26.21875)
    (list int frac))
    (26 0.21875)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, to return multiple values, we use the values operator:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (defun powers (x)
    (values x (sqrt x) (expt x 2)))
    POWERS
    > (multiple-value-bind (base root square) (powers 4)
    (list base root square))
    (4 2.0 16)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Functional programming is a good idea in general. It is a particularly
good idea in Lisp, because Lisp has evolved to support it. Built-in
operators like reverse and nreverse are meant to be used in this way.
Other operators, like values and multiple-value-bind, have been provided
specifically to make functional programming easier.

<<SEC25>>

** 3.2 Imperative Outside-In
The aims of functional programming may show more clearly when contrasted
with those of the more common approach, imperative programming. A
functional program tells you what it wants; an imperative program tells
you what to do. A functional program says "Return a list of a and the
square of the first element of x:"

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun fun (x)
      (list 'a (expt (car x) 2)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

An imperative programs says "Get the first element of x, then square it,
then return a list of a and the square:"

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun imp (x)
      (let (y sqr)
        (setq y (car x))
        (setq sqr (expt y 2))
        (list 'a sqr)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Lisp users are fortunate in being able to write this program both ways.
Some languages are only suited to imperative programming--notably Basic,
along with most machine languages. In fact, the definition of imp is
similar in form to the machine language code that most Lisp compilers
would generate for fun.

Why write such code when the compiler could do it for you? For many

programmers, this question does not even arise. A language stamps its
pattern on our thoughts: someone used to programming in an imperative
language may have begun to conceive of programs in imperative terms, and
may actually find it easier to write imperative programs than functional
ones. This habit of mind is worth overcoming if you have a language that
will let you.

For alumni of other languages, beginning to use Lisp may be like
stepping onto a skating rink for the first time. It's actually much
easier to get around on ice than it is on dry land--if you use skates.
Till then you will be left wondering what people see in this sport.

What skates are to ice, functional programming is to Lisp. Together the
two allow you to travel more gracefully, with less effort. But if you
are accustomed to another mode of travel, this may not be your
experience at first. One of the obstacles to learning Lisp as a second
language is learning to program in a functional style.

Fortunately there is a trick for transforming imperative programs into
functional ones. You can begin by applying this trick to finished code.
Soon you will begin to anticipate yourself, and transform your code as
you write it. Soon after that, you will begin to conceive of programs in
functional terms from the start.

The trick is to realize that an imperative program is a functional
program turned inside-out. To find the functional program implicit in
our imperative one, we just turn it outside-in. Let's try this technique
on imp.

The first thing we notice is the creation of y and sqr in the initial
let. This is a sign that bad things are to follow. Like eval at runtime,
uninitialized variables are so rarely needed that they should generally
be treated as a symptom of some illness in the program. Such variables
are often used like pins which hold the program down and keep it from
coiling into its natural shape.

However, we ignore them for the time being, and go straight to the end
of the function. What occurs last in an imperative program occurs
outermost in a functional one. So our first step is to grab the final
call to list and begin stuffing the rest of the program inside it--just
like turning a shirt inside-out. We continue by applying the same
transformation repeatedly, just as we would with the sleeves of the
shirt, and in turn with their cuffs.

Starting at the end, we replace sqr with (expt y 2), yielding:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (list 'a (expt y 2)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then we replace y by (car x):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (list 'a (expt (car x) 2))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now we can throw away the rest of the code, having stuffed it all into
the last expression. In the process we removed the need for the
variables y and sqr, so we can discard the let as well.

The final result is shorter than what we began with, and easier to
understand. In the original code, we're faced with the final expression
(list 'a sqr), and it's not immediately clear where the value of sqr
comes from. Now the source of the return value is laid out for us like a
road map.

The example in this section was a short one, but the technique scales
up. Indeed, it becomes more valuable as it is applied to larger
functions. Even functions which perform side-effects can be cleaned up
in the portions which don't.

<<SEC26>>

** 3.3 Functional Interfaces
Some side-effects are worse than others. For example, though this
function calls nconc

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun qualify (expr)
      (nconc (copy-list expr) (list 'maybe)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

it preserves referential transparency.[fn:8] If you call it
with a given argument, it will always return the same (equal) value.
From the caller's point of view, qualify might as well be purely
functional code. We can't say the same for bad-reverse (page 29), which
actually modifies its argument.

Instead of treating all side-effects as equally bad, it would be helpful
if we had some way of distinguishing between such cases. Informally, we
could say that it's harmless for a function to modify something that no
one else owns. For example, the nconc in qualify is harmless because the
list given as the first argument is freshly consed. No one else could
own it.

In the general case, we have to talk about ownership not by functions,
but by invocations of functions. Though no one else owns the variable x
here,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x 0))
      (defun total (y)
        (incf x y)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

the effects of one call will be visible in succeeding ones. So the rule
should be: a given invocation can safely modify what it uniquely owns.

Who owns arguments and return values? The convention in Lisp seems to be
that an invocation owns objects it receives as return values, but not
objects passed to it as arguments. Functions that modify their arguments
are distinguished by the label "destructive," but there is no special
name for functions that modify objects returned to them.

This function adheres to the convention, for example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun ok (x)
      (nconc (list 'a x) (list 'c)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

It calls nconc, which doesn't, but since the list spliced by nconc will
always be freshly made rather than, say, a list passed to ok as an
argument, ok itself is ok.

If it were written slightly differently, however,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun not-ok (x)
      (nconc (list 'a) x (list 'c)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then the call to nconc would be modifying an argument passed to not-ok.

Many Lisp programs violate this convention, at least locally. However,
as we saw with ok, local violations need not disqualify the calling
function. And functions which do meet the preceding conditions will
retain many of the advantages of purely functional code.

To write programs that are really indistinguishable from functional
code, we have to add one more condition. Functions can't share objects
with other code that doesn't follow the rules. For example, though this
function doesn't have side-effects,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun anything (x)
      (+ x *anything*))
#+END_EXAMPLE

its return value depends on the global variable *anything*. So if any
other function can alter the value of this variable, anything could
return anything.

Code written so that each invocation only modifies what it owns is
almost as good as purely functional code. A function that meets all the
preceding conditions at least presents a functional interface to the
world: if you call it twice with the same arguments, you should get the
same results. And this, as the next section will show, is a crucial
ingredient in bottom-up programming.

One problem with destructive operations is that, like global variables,
they can destroy the locality of a program. When you're writing
functional code, you can narrow your focus: you only need consider the
functions that call, or are called by, the one you're writing. This
benefit disappears when you want to modify something destructively. It
could be used anywhere.

The conditions above do not guarantee the perfect locality you get with
purely functional code, though they do improve things somewhat. For
example, suppose that f calls g as below:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun f (x)
      (let ((val (g x)))
        ; safe to modify val here?
        ))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Is it safe for f to nconc something onto val? Not if g is identity: then
we would be modifying something originally passed as an argument to f
itself.

So even in programs which do follow the convention, we may have to look
beyond f if we want to modify something there. However, we don't have to
look as far: instead of worrying about the whole program, we now only
have to consider the subtree beginning with f.

A corollary of the convention above is that functions shouldn't return
anything that isn't safe to modify. Thus one should avoid writing
functions whose return values incorporate quoted objects. If we define
exclaim so that its return value incorporates a quoted list,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun exclaim (expression)
      (append expression '(oh my)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then any later destructive modification of the return value

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (exclaim '(lions and tigers and bears))
    (LIONS AND TIGERS AND BEARS OH MY)
    > (nconc * '(goodness))
    (LIONS AND TIGERS AND BEARS OH MY GOODNESS)
#+END_EXAMPLE

could alter the list within the function:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (exclaim '(fixnums and bignums and floats))
    (FIXNUMS AND BIGNUMS AND FLOATS OH MY GOODNESS)
#+END_EXAMPLE

To make exclaim proof against such problems, it should be written:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun exclaim (expression)
      (append expression (list 'oh 'my)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

There is one major exception to the rule that functions shouldn't return
quoted lists: the functions which generate macro expansions. Macro
expanders can safely incorporate quoted lists in the expansions they
generate, if the expansions are going straight to the compiler.

Otherwise, one might as well be a suspicious of quoted lists generally.
Many other uses of them are likely to be something which ought to be
done with a macro like in (page 152).

<<SEC27>>

** 3.4 Interactive Programming
The previous sections presented the functional style as a good way of
organizing programs. But it is more than this. Lisp programmers did not
adopt the functional style purely for aesthetic reasons. They use it
because it makes their work easier. In Lisp's dynamic environment,
functional programs can be written with unusual speed, and at the same
time, can be unusually reliable.

In Lisp it is comparatively easy to debug programs. A lot of information
is available at runtime, which helps in tracing the causes of errors.
But even more important is the ease with which you can test programs.
You don't have to compile a program and test the whole thing at once.
You can test functions individually by calling them from the toplevel
loop.

Incremental testing is so valuable that Lisp style has evolved to take
advantage of it. Programs written in the functional style can be
understood one function at a time, and from the point of view of the
reader this is its main advantage. However, the functional style is also
perfectly adapted to incremental testing: programs written in this style
can also be tested one function at a time. When a function neither
examines nor alters external state, any bugs will appear immediately.
Such a function can affect the outside world only through its return
values. Insofar as these are what you expected, you can trust the code
which produced them.

Experienced Lisp programmers actually design their programs to be easy
to test:

1. They try to segregate side-effects in a few functions, allowing the
   greater part of the program to be written in a purely functional
   style.
2. If a function must perform side-effects, they try at least to give it
   a functional interface.
3. They give each function a single, well-defined purpose.

When a function is written, they can test it on a selection of
representative cases, then move on to the next one. If each brick does
what it's supposed to do, the wall will stand.

In Lisp, the wall can be better-designed as well. Imagine the kind of
conversation you would have with someone so far away that there was a
transmission delay of one minute. Now imagine speaking to someone in the
next room. You wouldn't just have the same conversation faster, you
would have a different kind of conversation. In Lisp, developing
software is like speaking face-to-face. You can test code as you're
writing it. And instant turnaround has just as dramatic an effect on
development as it does on conversation. You don't just write the same
program faster; you write a different kind of program.

How so? When testing is quicker you can do it more often. In Lisp, as in
any language, development is a cycle of writing and testing. But in Lisp
the cycle is very short: single functions, or even parts of functions.
And if you test everything as you write it, you will know where to look
when errors occur: in what you wrote last. Simple as it sounds, this
principle is to a large extent what makes bottom-up programming
feasible. It brings an extra degree of confidence which enables Lisp
programmers to break free, at least part of the time, from the old
plan-and-implement style of software development.

Section 1.1 stressed that bottom-up design is an evolutionary process.
You build up a language as you write a program in it. This approach can
work only if you trust the lower levels of code. If you really want to
use this layer as a language, you have to be able to assume, as you
would with any language, that any bugs you encounter are bugs in your
application and not in the language itself.

So your new abstractions are supposed to bear this heavy burden of
responsibility, and yet you're supposed to just spin them off as the
need arises? Just so; in Lisp you can have both. When you write programs
in a functional style and test them incrementally, you can have the
flexibility of doing things on the spur of the moment, plus the kind of
reliability one usually associates with careful planning.

--------------

<<SEC28>>

* 4. Utility Functions
Common Lisp operators come in three types: functions and macros, which
you can write yourself, and special forms, which you can't. This chapter
describes techniques for extending Lisp with new functions. But
"techniques" here means something different from what it usually does.
The important thing to know about such functions is not how they're
written, but where they come from. An extension to Lisp will be written
using mostly the same techniques you would use to write any other Lisp
function. The hard part of writing these extensions is not deciding how
to write them, but deciding which ones to write.

** 4.1 Birth of a Utility
In its simplest form, bottom-up programming means second-guessing
whoever designed your Lisp. At the same time as you write your program,
you also add to Lisp new operators which make your program easy to
write. These new operators are called utilities.

The term "utility" has no precise definition. A piece of code can be
called a utility if it seems too small to be considered as a separate
application, and too general-purpose to be considered as part of a
particular program. A database program would not be a utility, for
example, but a function which performed a single operation on a list
could be. Most utilities resemble the functions and macros that Lisp has
already. In fact, many of Common Lisp's built-in operators began life as
utilities. The function remove-if-not, which collects all the elements
of a list satisfying some predicate, was defined by individual
programmers for years before it became a part of Common Lisp.

Learning to write utilities would be better described as learning the
habit of writing them, rather than the technique of writing them.
Bottom-up programming means simultaneously writing a program and a
programming language. To do this well, you have to develop a fine sense
of which operators a program is lacking. You have to be able to look at
a program and say, "Ah, what you really mean to say is this."

For example, suppose that nicknames is a function which takes a name and
builds a list of all the nicknames which could be derived from it. Given
this function, how do we collect all the nicknames yielded by a list of
names? Someone learning Lisp might write a function like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun all-nicknames (names)
      (if (null names)
          nil
        (nconc (nicknames (car names))
           (all-nicknames (cdr names)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

A more experienced Lisp programmer can look at such a function and say
"Ah, what you really want is mapcan." Then instead of having to define
and call a new function to find all the nicknames of a group of people,
you can use a single expression:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mapcan #'nicknames people)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The definition of all-nicknames is reinventing the wheel. However,
that's not all that's wrong with it: it is also burying in a specific
function something that could be done by a general-purpose operator.

In this case the operator, mapcan, already exists. Anyone who knew about
mapcanwould feel a little uncomfortable looking at all-nicknames. To be
good at bottom-up programming is to feel equally uncomfortable when the
missing operator is one which hasn't been written yet. You must be able
to say "what you really want is x," and at the same time, to know what x
should be.

Lisp programming entails, among other things, spinning off new utilities
as you need them. The aim of this section is to show how such utilities
are born. Suppose that towns is a list of nearby towns, sorted from
nearest to farthest, and that bookshops is a function which returns a
list of all the bookshops in a city. If we want to find the nearest town
which has any bookshops, and the bookshops in it, we could begin with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((town (find-if #'bookshops towns)))
      (values town (bookshops town)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

But this is a bit inelegant: when find-if finds an element for which
bookshops returns a non-nil value, the value is thrown away, only to be
recomputed as soon as find-if returns. If bookshops were an expensive
call, this idiom would be inefficient as well as ugly. To avoid
unnecessary work, we could use the following function instead:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun find-books (towns)
      (if (null towns)
          nil
        (let ((shops (bookshops (car towns))))
          (if shops
          (values (car towns) shops)
        (find-books (cdr towns))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then calling (find-books towns) would at least get us what we wanted
with no more computation than necessary. But wait--isn't it likely that
at some time in the future we will want to do the same kind of search
again? What we really want here is a utility which combines find-if and
some, returning both the successful element, and the value returned by
the test function. Such a utility could be defined as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun find2 (fn lst)
      (if (null lst)
          nil
        (let ((val (funcall fn (car lst))))
          (if val
          (values (car lst) val)
        (find2 fn (cdr lst))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notice the similarity between find-books and find2. Indeed, the latter
could be described as the skeleton of the former. Now, using the new
utility, we can achieve our original aim with a single expression:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (find2 #'bookshops towns)
#+END_EXAMPLE

One of the unique characteristics of Lisp programming is the important
role of functions as arguments. This is part of why Lisp is well-adapted
to bottom-up programming. It's easier to abstract out the bones of a
function when you can pass the flesh back as a functional argument.

Introductory programming courses teach early on that abstraction leads
to less duplication of effort. One of the first lessons is: don't wire
in behavior. For example, instead of defining two functions which do the
same thing but for one or two constants, define a single function and
pass the constants as arguments. In Lisp we can carry this idea further,
because we can pass whole functions as arguments. In both of the
previous examples we went from a specific function to a more general
function which took a functional argument. In the first case we used the
predefined mapcan and in the second we wrote a new utility, find2, but
the general principle is the same: instead of mixing the general and the
specific, define the general and pass the specific as an argument.

When carefully applied, this principle yields noticeably more elegant
programs. It is not the only force driving bottom-up design, but it is a
major one. Of the 32 utilities defined in this chapter, 18 take
functional arguments.

<<SEC30>>

** 4.2 Invest in Abstraction
If brevity is the soul of wit, it is also, along with efficiency, the
essence of good software. The cost of writing or maintaining a program
increases with its length. All other things being equal, the shorter
program is the better.

From this point of view, the writing of utilities should be treated as a
capital expenditure. By replacing find-books with the utility find2, we
end up with just as many lines of code. But we have made the program
shorter in one sense, because the length of the utility does not have to
be charged against the current program.

It is not just an accounting trick to treat extensions to Lisp as
capital expenditures. Utilities can go into a separate file; they will
not clutter our view as we're working on the program, nor are they
likely to be involved if we have to return later to change the program
in some respect.

As capital expenditures, however, utilities demand extra attention. It
is especially important that they be well-written. They are going to be
used repeatedly, so any incorrectness or inefficiency will be
multiplied. Extra care must also go into their design: a new utility
must be written for the general case, not just for the problem at hand.
Finally, like any capital expenditure, we need not be in a hurry about
it. If you're thinking of spinning off some new operator, but aren't
sure that you will want it elsewhere, write it anyway, but leave it with
the particular program which uses it. Later if you use the new operator
in other programs, you can promote it from a subroutine to a utility and
make it generally accessible.

The utility find2 seems to be a good investment. By making a capital
outlay of 7 lines, we get an immediate savings of 7. The utility has
paid for itself in the first use. A programming language, Guy Steele
wrote, should "cooperate with our natural tendency towards brevity:"

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  . . .we tend to believe that the expense of a programming construct is
  proportional to the amount of writer's cramp that it causes us (by
  "belief" I mean here an unconscious tendency rather than a fervent
  conviction). Indeed, this is not a bad psychological principle for
  language designers to keep in mind. We think of addition as cheap
  partly because we can notate it with a single character: "+". Even if
  we believe that a construct is expensive, we will often prefer it to a
  cheaper one if it will cut our writing effort in half.
#+END_QUOTE

In any language, the "tendency towards brevity" will cause trouble
unless it is allowed to vent itself in new utilities. The shortest
idioms are rarely the most efficient ones. If we want to know whether
one list is longer than another, raw Lisp will tempt us to write

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (> (length x) (length y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we want to map a function over several lists, we will likewise be
tempted to join them together first:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mapcar fn (append x y z))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Such examples show that it's especially important to write utilities for
situations we might otherwise handle inefficiently. A language augmented
with the right utilities will lead us to write more abstract programs.
If these utilities are properly defined, it will also lead us to write
more efficient ones.

A collection of utilities will certainly make programming easier. But
they can do more than that: they can make you write better programs. The
muses, like cooks, spring into action at the sight of ingredients. This
is why artists like to have a lot of tools and materials in their
studios. They know that they are more likely to start something new if
they have what they need ready at hand. The same phenomenon appears with
programs written bottom-up. Once you have written a new utility, you may
find yourself using it more than you would have expected.

The following sections describe several classes of utility functions.
They do not by any means represent all the different types of functions
you might add to Lisp. However, all the utilities given as examples are
ones that have proven their worth in practice.

<<SEC31>>

** 4.3 Operations on Lists
Lists were originally Lisp's main data structure. Indeed, the name
"Lisp" comes from "LISt Processing." It is as well not to be misled by
this historical fact, however. Lisp is not inherently about processing
lists any more than Polo shirts are for Polo. A highly optimized Common
Lisp program might never see a list.

It would still be a list, though, at least at compile-time. The most
sophisticated programs, which use lists less at runtime, use them
proportionately more at compile-time, when generating macro expansions.
So although the role of lists is decreased in modern dialects,
operations on lists can still make up the greater part of a Lisp
program.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (proclaim '(inline last1 single append1 conc1 mklist))

    (defun last1 (lst)
      (car (last lst)))

    (defun single (lst)
      (and (consp lst) (not (cdr lst))))

    (defun append1 (lst obj)
      (append lst (list obj)))

    (defun conc1 (lst obj)
      (nconc lst (list obj)))

    (defun mklist (obj)
      (if (listp obj) obj (list obj)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 4.1: Small functions which operate on lists.

<<IDX4>>

Figures 4.1 and 4.2 contain a selection of functions which build or
examine lists. Those given in Figure 4.1 are among the smallest
utilities worth defining. For efficiency, they should all be declared
inline (page 26).

The first, last1, returns the last element in a list. The built-in
function last returns the last cons in a list, not the last element.
Most of the time one uses it to get the last element, by saying (car
(last ...)). Is it worth writing a new utility for such a case? Yes,
when it effectively replaces one of the built-in operators.

Notice that last1 does no error-checking. In general, none of the code
defined in this book will do error-checking. Partly this is just to make
the examples clearer. But in shorter utilities it is reasonable not to
do any error-checking anyway. If we try:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (last1 "blub")
    >>Error: "blub" is not a list.
    Broken at LAST...
#+END_EXAMPLE

the error will be caught by last itself. When utilities are small, they
form a layer of abstraction so thin that it starts to be transparent. As
one can see through a thin layer of ice, one can see through utilities
like last1 to interpret errors which arise in the underlying functions.

The function single tests whether something is a list of one element.
Lisp programs need to make this test rather often. At first one might be
tempted to use the natural translation from English:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (= (length lst) 1)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Written this way, the test would be very inefficient. We know all we
need to know as soon as we've looked past the first element.

Next come append1 and conc1. Both attach a new element to the end of a
list, the latter destructively. These functions are small, but so
frequently needed that they are worth defining. Indeed, append1 has been
predefined in previous Lisp dialects.

So has mklist, which was predefined in (at least) Interlisp. Its purpose
is to ensure that something is a list. Many Lisp functions are written
to return either a single value or a list of values. Suppose that lookup
is such a function, and that we want to collect the results of calling
it on all the elements of a list called data. We can do so by writing:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mapcan #'(lambda (d) (mklist (lookup d)))
        data)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 4.2 contains some larger examples of list utilities. The first,
longer, is useful from the point of view of efficiency as well as
abstraction. It compares two sequences and returns true only if the
first is longer. When comparing the lengths of two lists, it is tempting
to do just that:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (> (length x) (length y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This idiom is inefficient because it requires the program to traverse
the entire length of both lists. If one list is much longer than the
other, all the effort of traversing the difference in their lengths will
be wasted. It is faster to do as longer does and traverse the two lists
in parallel.

Embedded within longer is a recursive function to compare the lengths of
two lists. Since longer is for comparing lengths, it should work for
anything that you could give as an argument to length. But the
possibility of comparing lengths in parallel only applies to lists, so
the internal function is only called if both arguments are lists.

The next function, filter, is to some what remove-if-not is to find-if.
The built-in remove-if-not returns all the values that might have been
returned if you called find-if with the same function on successive cdrs
of a list. Analogously, filter returns what some would have returned for
successive cdrs of the list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (filter #'(lambda (x) (if (numberp x) (1+ x)))
    '(a 1 2 b 3 c d 4))
    (2 3 4 5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun longer (x y)
      (labels ((compare (x y)
                (and (consp x)
                 (or (null y)
                     (compare (cdr x) (cdr y))))))
        (if (and (listp x) (listp y))
        (compare x y)
          (> (length x) (length y)))))

    (defun filter (fn lst)
      (let ((acc nil))
        (dolist (x lst)
          (let ((val (funcall fn x)))
        (if val (push val acc))))
        (nreverse acc)))

    (defun group (source n)
      (if (zerop n) (error "zero length"))
      (labels ((rec (source acc)
            (let ((rest (nthcdr n source)))
              (if (consp rest)
                  (rec rest (cons (subseq source 0 n) acc))
                (nreverse (cons source acc))))))
        (if source (rec source nil) nil)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 4.2: Larger functions that operate on lists.

<<IDX5>>

You give filter a function and a list, and get back a list of whatever
non-nil values are returned by the function as it is applied to the
elements of the list.

Notice that filter uses an accumulator in the same way as the
tail-recursive functions described in Section 2.8. Indeed, the aim in
writing a tail-recursive function is to have the compiler generate code
in the shape of filter. For filter, the straightforward iterative
definition is simpler than the tail-recursive one. The combination of
push and nreverse in the definition of filter is the standard Lisp idiom
for accumulating a list.

The last function in Figure 4.2 is for grouping lists into sublists. You
give group a list l and a number n, and it will return a new list in
which the elements of l are grouped into sublists of length n. The
remainder is put in a final sublist. Thus if we give 2 as the second
argument, we get an assoc-list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (group '(a b c d e f g) 2)
    ((A B) (C D) (E F) (G))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This function is written in a rather convoluted way in order to make it
tail-recursive (Section 2.8). The principle of rapid prototyping applies
to individual functions as well as to whole programs. When writing a
function like flatten, it can be a good idea to begin with the simplest
possible implementation. Then, once the simpler version works, you can
replace it if necessary with a more efficient tail-recursive or
iterative version. If it's short enough, the initial version could be
left as a comment to describe the behavior of its replacement. (Simpler
versions of group and several other functions in Figures 4.2 and 4.3 are
included in the note on page 389.)

The definition of group is unusual in that it checks for at least one
error: a second argument of 0, which would otherwise send the function
into an infinite recursion.

In one respect, the examples in this book deviate from usual Lisp
practice: to make the chapters independent of one another, the code
examples are as much as possible written in raw Lisp. Because it is so
useful in defining macros, group is an exception, and will reappear at
several points in later chapters.

The functions in Figure 4.2 all work their way along the top-level
structure of a list. Figure 4.3 shows two examples of functions that
descend into nested lists. The first, flatten, was also predefined in
Interlisp. It returns a list of all the atoms that are elements of a
list, or elements of its elements, and so on:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (flatten '(a (b c) ((d e) f)))
    (A B C D E F)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The other function in Figure 4.3, prune, is to remove-if as copy-tree is
to copy-list. That is, it recurses down into sublists:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (prune #'evenp '(1 2 (3 (4 5) 6) 7 8 (9)))
    (1 (3 (5)) 7 (9))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Every leaf for which the function returns true is removed.

** 4.4 Search
This section gives some examples of functions for searching lists.
Common Lisp provides a rich set of built-in operators for this purpose,
but some tasks are still difficult--or at least difficult to perform
efficiently. We saw this in the hypothetical case described on page 41.
The first utility in Figure 4.4, find2, is the one we defined in
response to it.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun flatten (x)
      (labels ((rec (x acc)
            (cond ((null x) acc)
                  ((atom x) (cons x acc))
                  (t (rec (car x) (rec (cdr x) acc))))))
        (rec x nil)))

    (defun prune (test tree)
      (labels ((rec (tree acc)
            (cond ((null tree) (nreverse acc))
                  ((consp (car tree))
                   (rec (cdr tree)
                    (cons (rec (car tree) nil) acc)))
                  (t (rec (cdr tree)
                      (if (funcall test (car tree))
                      acc
                    (cons (car tree) acc)))))))
        (rec tree nil)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 4.3: Doubly-recursive list utilities.

<<IDX6>>

The next utility, before, is written with similar intentions. It tells
you if one object is found before another in a list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (before 'b 'd '(a b c d))
    (B C D)
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is easy enough to do this sloppily in raw Lisp:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (< (position 'b '(a b c d)) (position 'd '(a b c d)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

But the latter idiom is inefficient and error-prone: inefficient because
we don't need to find both objects, only the one that occurs first; and
error-prone because if either object isn't in the list, nil will be
passed as an argument to <. Using before fixes both problems.

Since before is similar in spirit to a test for membership, it is
written to resemble the built-in member function. Like member it takes
an optional test argument, which defaults to eql. Also, instead of
simply returning t, it tries to return potentially useful information:
the cdr beginning with the object given as the first argument.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun find2 (fn lst)
      (if (null lst)
          nil
        (let ((val (funcall fn (car lst))))
          (if val
          (values (car lst) val)
        (find2 fn (cdr lst))))))

    (defun before (x y lst &key (test #'eql))
      (and lst
           (let ((first (car lst)))
         (cond ((funcall test y first) nil)
               ((funcall test x first) lst)
               (t (before x y (cdr lst) :test test))))))

    (defun after (x y lst &key (test #'eql))
      (let ((rest (before y x lst :test test)))
        (and rest (member x rest :test test))))

    (defun duplicate (obj lst &key (test #'eql))
      (member obj (cdr (member obj lst :test test))
          :test test))

    (defun split-if (fn lst)
      (let ((acc nil))
        (do ((src lst (cdr src)))
        ((or (null src) (funcall fn (car src)))
         (values (nreverse acc) src))
          (push (car src) acc))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 4.4: Functions which search lists.

<<IDX7>>

Note that before returns true if we encounter the first argument before
encountering the second. Thus it will return true if the second argument
doesn't occur in the list at all:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (before 'a 'b '(a))
    (A)
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can peform a more exacting test by calling after, which requires that
both its arguments occur in the list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (after 'a 'b '(b a d))
    (A D)
    > (after 'a 'b '(a))
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

If (member o l) finds o in the list l, it also returns the cdr of l
beginning with o. This return value can be used, for example, to test
for duplication. If o is duplicated in l, then it will also be found in
the cdr of the list returned by member. This idiom is embodied in the
next utility, duplicate:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (duplicate 'a '(a b c a d))
    (A D)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Other utilities to test for duplication could be written on the same
principle.

More fastidious language designers are shocked that Common Lisp uses nil
to represent both falsity and the empty list. It does cause trouble
sometimes (see Section 14.2), but it is convenient in functions like
duplicate. In questions of sequence membership, it seems natural to
represent falsity as the empty sequence.

The last function in Figure 4.4 is also a kind of generalization of
member. While member returns the cdr of the list beginning with the
element it finds, split-if returns both halves. This utility is mainly
used with lists that are ordered in some respect:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (split-if #'(lambda (x) (> x 4))
    '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))
    (1 2 3 4)
    (5 6 7 8 9 10)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 4.5 contains search functions of another kind: those which
compare elements against one another. The first, most, looks at one
element at a time. It takes a list and a scoring function, and returns
the element with the highest score. In case of ties, the element
occurring first wins.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (most #'length '((a b) (a b c) (a) (e f g)))
    (A B C)
    3
#+END_EXAMPLE

For convenience, most also returns the score of the winner.

A more general kind of search is provided by best. This utility also
takes a function and a list, but here the function must be a predicate
of two arguments. It returns the element which, according to the
predicate, beats all the others.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun most (fn lst)
      (if (null lst)
          (values nil nil)
        (let* ((wins (car lst))
           (max (funcall fn wins)))
          (dolist (obj (cdr lst))
        (let ((score (funcall fn obj)))
          (when (> score max)
            (setq wins obj
              max score))))
          (values wins max))))

    (defun best (fn lst)
      (if (null lst)
          nil
        (let ((wins (car lst)))
          (dolist (obj (cdr lst))
        (if (funcall fn obj wins)
            (setq wins obj)))
          wins)))

    (defun mostn (fn lst)
      (if (null lst)
          (values nil nil)
        (let ((result (list (car lst)))
          (max (funcall fn (car lst))))
          (dolist (obj (cdr lst))
        (let ((score (funcall fn obj)))
          (cond ((> score max)
             (setq max score
                   result (list obj)))
            ((= score max)
             (push obj result)))))
          (values (nreverse result) max))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 4.5: Search functions which compare elements.

<<IDX8>>

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (best #'> '(1 2 3 4 5))
    5
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can think of best as being equivalent to car of sort, but much more
efficient. It is up to the caller to provide a predicate which defines a
total order on the elements of the list. Otherwise the order of the
elements will influence the result; as before, in case of ties, the
first element wins.

Finally, mostn takes a function and a list and returns a list of all the
elements for which the function yields the highest score (along with the
score itself):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mostn #'length '((a b) (a b c) (a) (e f g)))
    ((A B C) (E F G))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<SEC33>>

** 4.5 Mapping
Another widely used class of Lisp functions are the mapping functions,
which apply a function to a sequence of arguments. Figure 4.6 shows some
examples of new mapping functions. The first three are for applying a
function to a range of numbers without having to cons up a list to
contain them. The first two, map0-n and map1-n, work for ranges of
positive integers:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (map0-n #'1+ 5)
    (1 2 3 4 5 6)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Both are written using the more general mapa-b, which works for any
range of numbers:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapa-b #'1+ -2 0 .5)
    (-1 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Following mapa-b is the still more general map->, which works for
sequences of objects of any kind. The sequence begins with the object
given as the second argument, the end of the sequence is defined by the
function given as the third argument, and successors are generated by
the function given as the fourth argument. With map-> it is possible to
navigate arbitrary data structures, as well as operate on sequences of
numbers. We could define mapa-b in terms of map-> as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun mapa-b (fn a b &optional (step 1))
      (map-> fn
         a
         #'(lambda (x) (> x b))
         #'(lambda (x) (+ x step))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun map0-n (fn n)
      (mapa-b fn 0 n))

    (defun map1-n (fn n)
      (mapa-b fn 1 n))

    (defun mapa-b (fn a b &optional (step 1))
      (do ((i a (+ i step))
           (result nil))
          ((> i b) (nreverse result))
        (push (funcall fn i) result)))

    (defun map-> (fn start test-fn succ-fn)
      (do ((i start (funcall succ-fn i))
           (result nil))
          ((funcall test-fn i) (nreverse result))
        (push (funcall fn i) result)))

    (defun mappend (fn &rest lsts)
      (apply #'append (apply #'mapcar fn lsts)))

    (defun mapcars (fn &rest lsts)
      (let ((result nil))
        (dolist (lst lsts)
          (dolist (obj lst)
        (push (funcall fn obj) result)))
        (nreverse result)))

    (defun rmapcar (fn &rest args)
      (if (some #'atom args)
          (apply fn args)
        (apply #'mapcar
           #'(lambda (&rest args)
               (apply #'rmapcar fn args))
           args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 4.6: Mapping functions.

<<IDX9>>

For efficiency, the built-in mapcan is destructive. It could be
duplicated by:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-mapcan (fn &rest lsts)
      (apply #'nconc (apply #'mapcar fn lsts)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Because mapcan splices together lists with nconc, the lists returned by
the first argument had better be newly created, or the next time we look
at them they might be altered. That's why nicknames (page 41) was
defined as a function which "builds a list" of nicknames. If it simply
returned a list stored elsewhere, it wouldn't have been safe to use
mapcan. Instead we would have had to splice the returned lists with
append. For such cases, mappend offers a nondestructive alternative to
mapcan.

The next utility, mapcars, is for cases where we want to mapcar a
function over several lists. If we have two lists of numbers and we want
to get a single list of the square roots of both, using raw Lisp we
could say

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mapcar #'sqrt (append list1 list2))
#+END_EXAMPLE

but this conses unnecessarily. We append together list1 and list2 only
to discard the result immediately. With mapcars we can get the same
result from:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mapcars #'sqrt list1 list2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

and do no unnecessary consing.

The final function in Figure 4.6 is a version of mapcar for trees. Its
name, rmapcar, is short for "recursive mapcar," and what mapcar does on
flat lists, it does on trees:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (rmapcar #'princ '(1 2 (3 4 (5) 6) 7 (8 9)))
    123456789
    (1 2 (3 4 (5) 6) 7 (8 9))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Like mapcar, it can take more than one list argument.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (rmapcar #'+ '(1 (2 (3) 4)) '(10 (20 (30) 40)))
    (11 (22 (33) 44))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Several of the functions which appear later on ought really to call
rmapcar, including rep on page 324.

To some extent, traditional list mapping functions may be rendered
obsolete by the new series macros introduced in CLTL2. For example,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mapa-b #'fn a b c)
#+END_EXAMPLE

could be rendered

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (collect (#Mfn (scan-range :from a :upto b :by c)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun readlist (&rest args)
      (values (read-from-string
           (concatenate 'string "("
                (apply #'read-line args)
                ")"))))

    (defun prompt (&rest args)
      (apply #'format *query-io* args)
      (read *query-io*))

    (defun break-loop (fn quit &rest args)
      (format *query-io* "Entering break-loop.~%")
      (loop
       (let ((in (apply #'prompt args)))
         (if (funcall quit in)
         (return)
           (format *query-io* "~A~%" (funcall fn in))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 4.7: I/O functions.

<<IDX10>>

However, there is still some call for mapping functions. A mapping
function may in some cases be clearer or more elegant. Some things we
could express with map-> might be difficult to express using series.
Finally, mapping functions, as functions, can be passed as arguments.

<<SEC34>>

** 4.6 I/O
Figure 4.7 contains three examples of I/O utilities. The need for this
kind of utility varies from program to program. Those in Figure 4.7 are
just a representative sample. The first is for the case where you want
users to be able to type in expressions without parentheses; it reads a
line of input and returns it as a list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (readlist)
    Call me "Ed"
    (CALL ME "Ed")
#+END_EXAMPLE

The call to values ensures that we get only one value back
(read-from-string itself returns a second value that is irrelevant in
this case).

The function prompt combines printing a question and reading the answer.
It takes the arguments of format, except the initial stream argument.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (prompt "Enter a number between ~A and ~A.~%>> " 1 10)
    Enter a number between 1 and 10.
    >> 3
    3
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, break-loop is for situations where you want to imitate the Lisp
toplevel. It takes two functions and an &rest argument, which is
repeatedly given to prompt. As long as the second function returns false
for the input, the first function is applied to it. So for example we
could simulate the actual Lisp toplevel with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (break-loop #'eval #'(lambda (x) (eq x :q)) ">> ")
    Entering break-loop.
    >> (+ 2 3)
    5
    >> :q
    :Q
#+END_EXAMPLE

This, by the way, is the reason Common Lisp vendors generally insist on
runtime licenses. If you can call eval at runtime, then any Lisp program
can include Lisp.

<<SEC35>>

** 4.7 Symbols and Strings
Symbols and strings are closely related. By means of printing and
reading functions we can go back and forth between the two
representations. Figure 4.8 contains examples of utilities which operate
on this border. The first, mkstr, takes any number of arguments and
concatenates their printed representations into a string:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mkstr pi " pieces of " 'pi)
#+END_EXAMPLE

"3.141592653589793 pieces of PI" Built upon it is symb, which is mostly
used for building symbols. It takes one or more arguments and returns
the symbol (creating one if necessary) whose print-name is their
concatenation. It can take as an argument any object which has a
printable representation: symbols, strings, numbers, even lists.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (symb 'ar "Madi" #\L #\L 0)
    |ARMadiLL0|
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun mkstr (&rest args)
      (with-output-to-string (s)
                 (dolist (a args) (princ a s))))

    (defun symb (&rest args)
      (values (intern (apply #'mkstr args))))

    (defun reread (&rest args)
      (values (read-from-string (apply #'mkstr args))))

    (defun explode (sym)
      (map 'list #'(lambda (c)
             (intern (make-string 1
                          :initial-element c)))
           (symbol-name sym)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 4.8: Functions which operate on symbols and strings.

<<IDX11>>

After calling mkstr to concatenate all its arguments into a single
string, symb sends the string to intern. This function is Lisp's
traditional symbol-builder: it takes a string and either finds the
symbol which prints as the string, or makes a new one which does.

Any string can be the print-name of a symbol, even a string containing
lower-case letters or macro characters like parentheses. When a symbol's
name contains such oddities, it is printed within vertical bars, as
above. In source code, such symbols should either be enclosed in
vertical bars, or the offending characters preceded by backslashes:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((s (symb '(a b))))
    (and (eq s '|(A B)|) (eq s '\(A\ B\))))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

The next function, reread, is a generalization of symb. It takes a
series of objects, and prints and rereads them. It can return symbols
like symb, but it can also return anything else that read can.
Read-macros will be invoked instead of being treated as part of a
symbol's name, and a:b will be read as the symbol b in package a,
instead of the symbol |a:b| in the current
package.[fn:9] The more general function is also pickier:
reread will generate an error if its arguments are not proper Lisp
syntax.

The last function in Figure 4.8 was predefined in several earlier
dialects: explode takes a symbol and returns a list of symbols made from
the characters in its name.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (explode 'bomb)
    (B O M B)
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is no accident that this function wasn't included in Common Lisp. If
you find yourself wanting to take apart symbols, you're probably doing
something inefficient. However, there is a place for this kind of
utility in prototypes, if not in production software.

<<SEC36>>

** 4.8 Density
If your code uses a lot of new utilities, some readers may complain that
it is hard to understand. People who are not yet very fluent in Lisp
will only be used to reading raw Lisp. In fact, they may not be used to
the idea of an extensible language at all. When they look at a program
which depends heavily on utilities, it may seem to them that the author
has, out of pure eccentricity, decided to write the program in some sort
of private language.

All these new operators, it might be argued, make the program harder to
read. One has to understand them all before being able to read the
program. To see why this kind of statement is mistaken, consider the
case described on page 41, in which we want to find the nearest
bookshops. If you wrote the program using find2, someone could complain
that they had to understand the definition of this new utility before
they could read your program. Well, suppose you hadn't used find2. Then,
instead of having to understand the definition of find2, the reader
would have had to understand the definition of find-books, in which the
function of find2 is mixed up with the specific task of finding
bookshops. It is no more difficult to understand find2 than find-books.
And here we have only used the new utility once. Utilities are meant to
be used repeatedly. In a real program, it might be a choice between
having to understand find2, and having to understand three or four
specialized search routines. Surely the former is easier.

So yes, reading a bottom-up program requires one to understand all the
new operators defined by the author. But this will nearly always be less
work than having to understand all the code that would have been
required without them.

If people complain that using utilities makes your code hard to read,
they probably don't realize what the code would look like if you hadn't
used them. Bottom-up programming makes what would otherwise be a large
program look like a small, simple one. This can give the impression that
the program doesn't do much, and should therefore be easy to read. When
inexperienced readers look closer and find that this isn't so, they
react with dismay.

We find the same phenomenon in other fields: a well-designed machine may
have fewer parts, and yet look more complicated, because it is packed
into a smaller space. Bottom-up programs are conceptually denser. It may
take an effort to read them, but not as much as it would take if they
hadn't been written that way.

There is one case in which you might deliberately avoid using utilities:
if you had to write a small program to be distributed independently of
the rest of your code. A utility usually pays for itself after two or
three uses, but in a small program, a utility might not be used enough
to justify including it.

<<SEC37>>

* 5. Returning Functions
The previous chapter showed how the ability to pass functions as
arguments leads to greater possibilities for abstraction. The more we
can do to functions, the more we can take advantage of these
possibilities. By defining functions to build and return new functions,
we can magnify the effect of utilities which take functions as
arguments.

The utilities in this chapter operate on functions. It would be more
natural, at least in Common Lisp, to write many of them to operate on
expressions--that is, as macros. A layer of macros will be superimposed
on some of these operators in Chapter 15. However, it is important to
know what part of the task can be done with functions, even if we will
eventually call these functions only through macros.

** 5.1 Common Lisp Evolves
Common Lisp originally provided several pairs of complementary
functions. The functions remove-if and remove-if-not make one such pair.
If pred is a predicate of one argument, then

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (remove-if-not #'pred lst)
#+END_EXAMPLE

is equivalent to

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (remove-if #'(lambda (x) (not (pred x))) lst)
#+END_EXAMPLE

By varying the function given as an argument to one, we can duplicate
the effect of the other. In that case, why have both? CLTL2 includes a
new function intended for cases like this: complement takes a predicate
p and returns a function which always returns the opposite value. When p
returns true, the complement returns false, and vice versa. Now we can
replace

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (remove-if-not #'pred lst)
#+END_EXAMPLE

with the equivalent

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (remove-if (complement #'pred) lst)
#+END_EXAMPLE

With complement, there is little justification for continuing to use the
-if-not functions.[fn:10] Indeed, CLTL2 (p. 391) says that
their use is now deprecated. If they remain in Common Lisp, it will only
be for the sake of compatibility.

The new complement operator is the tip of an important iceberg:
functions which return functions. This has long been an important part
of the idiom of Scheme. Scheme was the first Lisp to make functions
lexical closures, and it is this which makes it interesting to have
functions as return values.

It's not that we couldn't return functions in a dynamically scoped Lisp.
The following function would work the same under dynamic or lexical
scope:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun joiner (obj)
      (typecase obj
        (cons #'append)
        (number #'+)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

It takes an object and, depending on its type, returns a function to add
such objects together. We could use it to define a polymorphic join
function that worked for numbers or lists:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun join (&rest args)
      (apply (joiner (car args)) args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, returning constant functions is the limit of what we can do
with dynamic scope. What we can't do (well) is build functions at
runtime; joiner can return one of two functions, but the two choices are
fixed.

On page 18 we saw another function for returning functions, which relied
on lexical scope:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun make-adder (n)
      #'(lambda (x) (+ x n)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Calling make-adder will yield a closure whose behavior depends on the
value originally given as an argument:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq add3 (make-adder 3))
    #<Interpreted-Function BF1356>
    > (funcall add3 2)
    5
#+END_EXAMPLE

Under lexical scope, instead of merely choosing among a group of
constant functions, we can build new closures at runtime. With dynamic
scope this technique is impossible.[fn:11] If we consider
how complement would be written, we see that it too must return a
closure:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun complement (fn)
      #'(lambda (&rest args) (not (apply fn args))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The function returned by complement uses the value of the parameter fn
when complement was called. So instead of just choosing from a group of
constant functions, complement can custom-build the inverse of any
function:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (remove-if (complement #'oddp) '(1 2 3 4 5 6))
    (1 3 5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Being able to pass functions as arguments is a powerful tool for
abstraction. The ability to write functions which return functions
allows us to make the most of it. The remaining sections present several
examples of utilities which return functions.

<<SEC39>>

** 5.2 Orthogonality
An orthogonal language is one in which you can express a lot by
combining a small number of operators in a lot of different ways. Toy
blocks are very orthogonal; a plastic model kit is hardly orthogonal at
all. The main advantage of complement is that it makes a language more
orthogonal. Before complement, Common Lisp had pairs of functions like
remove-if and remove-if-not, subst-if and subst-if-not, and so on. With
complement we can do without half of them.

The setf macro also improves Lisp's orthogonality. Earlier dialects of
Lisp would often have pairs of functions for reading and writing data.
With property-lists, for example, there would be one function to
establish properties and another function to ask about them. In Common
Lisp, we have only the latter, get. To establish a property, we use get
in combination with setf:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (get 'ball 'color) 'red)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defvar *!equivs* (make-hash-table))

    (defun ! (fn)
      (or (gethash fn *!equivs*) fn))

    (defun def! (fn fn!)
      (setf (gethash fn *!equivs*) fn!))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 5.1: Returning destructive equivalents.

<<IDX12>>

We may not be able to make Common Lisp smaller, but we can do something
almost as good: use a smaller subset of it. Can we define any new
operators which would, like complement and setf, help us toward this
goal? There is at least one other way in which functions are grouped in
pairs. Many functions also come in a destructive version: remove-if and
delete-if, reverse and nreverse, append and nconc. By defining an
operator to return the destructive counterpart of a function, we would
not have to refer to the destructive functions directly.

Figure 5.1 contains code to support the notion of destructive
counterparts. The global hash-table *!equivs*maps functions to their
destructive equivalents; ! returns destructive equivalents; and def!
sets them. The name of the ! (bang) operator comes from the Scheme
convention of appending ! to the names of functions with side-effects.
Now once we have defined

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (def! #'remove-if #'delete-if)
#+END_EXAMPLE

then instead of

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (delete-if #'oddp lst)
#+END_EXAMPLE

we would say

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (funcall (! #'remove-if) #'oddp lst)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here the awkwardness of Common Lisp masks the basic elegance of the
idea, which would be more visible in Scheme:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ((! remove-if) oddp lst)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun memoize (fn)
      (let ((cache (make-hash-table :test #'equal)))
        #'(lambda (&rest args)
        (multiple-value-bind (val win) (gethash args cache)
          (if win
              val
            (setf (gethash args cache)
              (apply fn args)))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 5.2: Memoizing utility.

<<IDX13>>

As well as greater orthogonality, the ! operator brings a couple of
other benefits. It makes programs clearer, because we can see
immediately that (! #'foo) is the destructive equivalent of foo. Also,
it gives destructive operations a distinct, recognizable form in source
code, which is good because they should receive special attention when
we are searching for a bug.

Since the relation between a function and its destructive counterpart
will usually be known before runtime, it would be most efficient to
define ! as a macro, or even provide a read macro for it.

<<Memoizing>><<SEC40>>

** 5.3 Memoizing
If some function is expensive to compute, and we expect sometimes to
make the same call more than once, then it pays to memoize: to cache the
return values of all the previous calls, and each time the function is
about to be called, to look first in the cache to see if the value is
already known.

Figure 5.2 contains a generalized memoizing utility. We give a function
to memoize, and it returns an equivalent memoized version--a closure
containing a hash-table in which to store the results of previous calls.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq slowid (memoize #'(lambda (x) (sleep 5) x)))
    #<Interpreted-Function C38346>
    > (time (funcall slowid 1))
    Elapsed Time = 5.15 seconds
    1
    > (time (funcall slowid 1))
    Elapsed Time = 0.00 seconds
    1
#+END_EXAMPLE

With a memoized function, repeated calls are just hash-table lookups.
There is of course the additional expense of a lookup on each initial
call, but since we would only memoize a function that was sufficiently
expensive to compute, it's reasonable to assume that this cost is
insignificant in comparison.

Though adequate for most uses, this implementation of memoize has
several limitations. It treats calls as identical if they have equal
argument lists; this could be too strict if the function had keyword
parameters. Also, it is intended only for single-valued functions, and
cannot store or return multiple values.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun compose (&rest fns)
      (if fns
          (let ((fn1 (car (last fns)))
            (fns (butlast fns)))
        #'(lambda (&rest args)
            (reduce #'funcall fns
                :from-end t
                :initial-value (apply fn1 args))))
        #'identity))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 5.3: An operator for functional composition.

** 5.4 Composing Functions
The complement of a function f is denoted #f. Section 5.1 showed that
closures make it possible to define # as a Lisp function. Another common
operation on functions is composition, denoted by the operator #. If f
and g are functions, then f #g is also a function, and f #g(x) = f
(g(x)). Closures also make it possible to define # as a Lisp function.

Figure 5.3 defines a compose function which takes any number of
functions and returns their composition. For example

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (compose #'list #'1+)
#+END_EXAMPLE

returns a function equivalent to

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #'(lambda (x) (list (1+ x)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

All the functions given as arguments to compose must be functions of one
argument, except the last. On the last function there are no
restrictions, and whatever arguments it takes, so will the function
returned by compose:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (funcall (compose #'1+ #'find-if) #'oddp '(2 3 4))
    4
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun fif (if then &optional else)
      #'(lambda (x)
          (if (funcall if x)
          (funcall then x)
        (if else (funcall else x)))))

    (defun fint (fn &rest fns)
      (if (null fns)
          fn
        (let ((chain (apply #'fint fns)))
          #'(lambda (x)
          (and (funcall fn x) (funcall chain x))))))

    (defun fun (fn &rest fns)
      (if (null fns)
          fn
        (let ((chain (apply #'fun fns)))
          #'(lambda (x)
          (or (funcall fn x) (funcall chain x))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 5.4: More function builders.

<<IDX15>>

Since not is a Lisp function, complement is a special case of compose.
It could be defined as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun complement (pred)
      (compose #'not pred))
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can combine functions in other ways than by composing them. For
example, we often see expressions like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mapcar #'(lambda (x)
            (if (slave x)
            (owner x)
              (employer x)))
        people)
#+END_EXAMPLE

We could define an operator to build functions like this one
automatically. Using fif from Figure 5.4, we could get the same effect
with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mapcar (fif #'slave #'owner #'employer)
        people)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 5.4 contains several other constructors for commonly occurring
types of functions. The second, fint, is for cases like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (find-if #'(lambda (x)
             (and (signed x) (sealed x) (delivered x)))
         docs)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The predicate given as the second argument to find-if defines the
intersection of the three predicates called within it. With fint, whose
name stands for "function intersection," we can say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (find-if (fint #'signed #'sealed #'delivered) docs)
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can define a similar operator to return the union of a set of
predicates. The function fun is like fint but uses or instead of and.

<<Recursion on Cdrs>><<SEC42>>

** 5.5 Recursion on Cdrs
Recursive functions are so important in Lisp programs that it would be
worth having utilities to build them. This section and the next describe
functions which build the two most common types. In Common Lisp, these
functions are a little awkward to use. Once we get into the subject of
macros, we will see how to put a more elegant facade on this machinery.
Macros for building recursers are discussed in Sections 15.2 and 15.3.

Repeated patterns in a program are a sign that it could have been
written at a higher level of abstraction. What pattern is more commonly
seen in Lisp programs than a function like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-length (lst)
      (if (null lst)
          0
        (1+ (our-length (cdr lst)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

or this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-every (fn lst)
      (if (null lst)
          t
        (and (funcall fn (car lst))
         (our-every fn (cdr lst)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Structurally these two functions have a lot in common. They both operate
recursively on successive cdrs of a list, evaluating the same expression
on each step,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun lrec (rec &optional base)
      (labels ((self (lst)
             (if (null lst)
                 (if (functionp base)
                 (funcall base)
                   base)
               (funcall rec (car lst)
                    #'(lambda ()
                    (self (cdr lst)))))))
        #'self))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 5.5: Function to define flat list recursers.

<<IDX16>>

except in the base case, where they return a distinct value. This
pattern appears so frequently in Lisp programs that experienced
programmers can read and reproduce it without stopping to think. Indeed,
the lesson is so quickly learned, that the question of how to package
the pattern in a new abstraction does not arise.

However, a pattern it is, all the same. Instead of writing these
functions out by hand, we should be able to write a function which will
generate them for us. Figure 5.5 contains a function-builder called lrec
("list recurser") which should be able to generate most functions that
recurse on successive cdrs of a list.

The first argument to lrec must be a function of two arguments: the
current car of the list, and a function which can be called to continue
the recursion. Using lrec we could express our-length as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (lrec #'(lambda (x f) (1+ (funcall f))) 0)
#+END_EXAMPLE

To find the length of the list, we don't need to look at the elements,
or stop part- way, so the object x is always ignored, and the function f
always called. However, we need to take advantage of both possibilities
to express our-every, for e.g. oddp:[fn:12]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (lrec #'(lambda (x f) (and (oddp x) (funcall f))) t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The definition of lrec uses labels to build a local recursive function
called self. In the recursive case the function rec is passed two
arguments, the current car of the list, and a function embodying the
recursive call. In functions like our-every, where the recursive case is
an and, if the first argument returns false we want to stop right there.
Which means that the argument passed in the recursive case must not be a
value but a function, which we can call (if we want) in order to get a
value.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ; copy-list
    (lrec #'(lambda (x f) (cons x (funcall f))))

    ; remove-duplicates
    (lrec #'(lambda (x f) (adjoin x (funcall f))))

    ; find-if, for some function fn
    (lrec #'(lambda (x f) (if (fn x) x (funcall f))))

    ; some, for some function fn
    (lrec #'(lambda (x f) (or (fn x) (funcall f))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 5.6: Functions expressed with lrec.

<<IDX17>>

Figure 5.6 shows some existing Common Lisp functions defined with
lrec. [fn:13]Calling lrec will not always yield the most
efficient implementation of a given function. Indeed, lrec and the other
recurser generators to be defined in this chapter tend to lead one away
from tail-recursive solutions. For this reason they are best suited for
use in initial versions of a program, or in parts where speed is not
critical.

<<Recursion on Subtrees>><<SEC43>>

** 5.6 Recursion on Subtrees
There is another recursive pattern commonly found in Lisp programs:
recursion on subtrees. This pattern is seen in cases where you begin
with a possibly nested list, and want to recurse down both its car and
its cdr.

The Lisp list is a versatile structure. Lists can represent, among other
things, sequences, sets, mappings, arrays, and trees. There are several
different ways to interpret a list as a tree. The most common is to
regard the list as a binary tree whose left branch is the car and whose
right branch is the cdr. (In fact, this is usually the internal
representation of lists.) Figure 5.7 shows three examples of lists and
the trees they represent. Each internal node in such a tree corresponds
to a dot in the dotted-pair representation of the list, so the tree
structure may be easier to interpret if the lists are considered in that
form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (a b c) = (a . (b . (c . nil)))
    (a b (c d)) = (a . (b . ((c . (d . nil)) . nil)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (a . b) (a b c) (a b (c d))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 5.7: Lists as trees.

<<IDX18>>

Any list can be interpreted as a binary tree. Hence the distinction
between pairs of Common Lisp functions like copy-list and copy-tree. The
former copies a list as a sequence--if the list contains sublists, the
sublists, being mere elements in the sequence, are not copied:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq x '(a b)
    listx (list x 1))
    ((A B) 1)
    > (eq x (car (copy-list listx)))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

In contrast, copy-tree copies a list as a tree--sublists are subtrees,
and so must also be copied:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (eq x (car (copy-tree listx)))
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

We could define a version of copy-tree as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-copy-tree (tree)
      (if (atom tree)
          tree
        (cons (our-copy-tree (car tree))
          (if (cdr tree) (our-copy-tree (cdr tree))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This definition turns out to be one instance of a common pattern. (Some
of the following functions are written a little oddly in order to make
the pattern obvious.) Consider for example a utility to count the number
of leaves in a tree:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun count-leaves (tree)
      (if (atom tree)
          1
        (+ (count-leaves (car tree))
           (or (if (cdr tree) (count-leaves (cdr tree)))
           1))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

A tree has more leaves than the atoms you can see when it is represented
as a list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (count-leaves '((a b (c d)) (e) f))
    10
#+END_EXAMPLE

The leaves of a tree are all the atoms you can see when you look at the
tree in its dotted-pair representation. In dotted-pair notation, ((a b
(c d)) (e) f) would have four nils that aren't visible in the list
representation (one for each pair of parentheses) so count-leaves
returns 10.

In the last chapter we defined several utilities which operate on trees.
For example, flatten (page 47) takes a tree and returns a list of all
the atoms in it. That is, if you give flatten a nested list, you'll get
back a list that looks the same except that it's missing all but the
outermost pair of parentheses:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (flatten '((a b (c d)) (e) f ()))
    (A B C D E F)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This function could also be defined (somewhat inefficiently) as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun flatten (tree)
      (if (atom tree)
          (mklist tree)
        (nconc (flatten (car tree))
           (if (cdr tree) (flatten (cdr tree))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, consider rfind-if, a recursive version of find-if which works
on trees as well as flat lists:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun rfind-if (fn tree)
      (if (atom tree)
          (and (funcall fn tree) tree)
        (or (rfind-if fn (car tree))
        (if (cdr tree) (rfind-if fn (cdr tree))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

To generalize find-if for trees, we have to decide whether we want to
search for just leaves, or for whole subtrees. Our rfind-if takes the
former approach, so the caller can assume that the function given as the
first argument will only be called on atoms:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (rfind-if (fint #'numberp #'oddp) '(2 (3 4) 5))
    3
#+END_EXAMPLE

How similar in form are these four functions, copy-tree, count-leaves,
flatten, and rfind-if. Indeed, they're all instances of an archetypal
function for recursion on subtrees. As with recursion on cdrs, we need
not leave this archetype to float vaguely in the background--we can
write a function to generate instances of it.

To get at the archetype itself, let's look at these functions and see
what's not pattern. Essentially our-copy-tree is two facts:

1. In the base case it returns its argument.
2. In the recursive case, it applies cons to the recursions down the
   left (car) and right (cdr) subtrees.

We should thus be able to express it as a call to a builder with two
arguments:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (ttrav #'cons #'identity)
#+END_EXAMPLE

A definition of ttrav ("tree traverser") is shown in Figure 5.8. Instead
of passing one value in the recursive case, we pass two, one for the
left subtree and one for the right. If the base argument is a function
it will be called on the current leaf. In flat list recursion, the base
case is always nil, but in tree recursion the base case could be an
interesting value, and we might want to use it.

With ttrav we could express all the preceding functions except rfind-if.
(They are shown in Figure 5.9.) To define rfind-if we need a more
general tree recursion builder which gives us control over when, and if,
the recursive calls are made. As the first argument to ttrav we gave a
function which took the results of the recursive calls. For the general
case, we want to use instead a function which takes two closures
representing the calls themselves. Then we can write recursers which
only traverse as much of the tree as they want to.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun ttrav (rec &optional (base #'identity))
      (labels ((self (tree)
             (if (atom tree)
                 (if (functionp base)
                 (funcall base tree)
                   base)
               (funcall rec (self (car tree))
                    (if (cdr tree)
                    (self (cdr tree)))))))
        #'self))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 5.8: Function for recursion on trees.

<<IDX19>>

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ; our-copy-tree
    (ttrav #'cons)

    ; count-leaves
    (ttrav #'(lambda (l r) (+ l (or r 1))) 1)

    ; flatten
    (ttrav #'nconc #'mklist)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 5.9: Functions expressed with ttrav.

<<IDX20>>

Functions built by ttrav always traverse a whole tree. That's fine for
functions like count-leaves or flatten, which have to traverse the whole
tree anyway. But we want rfind-if to stop searching as soon as it finds
what it's looking for. It must be built by the more general trec, shown
in Figure 5.10. The second arg to trec should be a function of three
arguments: the current object and the two recursers. The latter two will
be closures representing the recursions down the left and right
subtrees. With trec we would define flatten as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (trec #'(lambda (o l r) (nconc (funcall l) (funcall r)))
          #'mklist)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now we can also express rfind-if for e.g. oddp as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (trec #'(lambda (o l r) (or (funcall l) (funcall r)))
          #'(lambda (tree) (and (oddp tree) tree)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun trec (rec &optional (base #'identity))
      (labels
          ((self (tree)
             (if (atom tree)
             (if (functionp base)
                 (funcall base tree)
               base)
               (funcall rec tree
                #'(lambda ()
                    (self (car tree)))
                #'(lambda ()
                    (if (cdr tree)
                    (self (cdr tree))))))))
        #'self))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<When to Build Functions>><<SEC44>>

** 5.7 When to Build Functions
Expressing functions by calls to constructors instead of sharp-quoted
lambda-expressions could, unfortunately, entail unnecessary work at
runtime. A sharp-quoted lambda-expression is a constant, but a call to a
constructor function will be evaluated at runtime. If we really have to
make this call at runtime, it might not be worth using constructor
functions. However, at least some of the time we can call the
constructor beforehand. By using #., the sharp-dot read macro, we can
have the new functions built at read-time. So long as compose and its
arguments are defined when this expression is read, we could say, for
example,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (find-if #.(compose #'oddp #'truncate) lst)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then the call to compose would be evaluated by the reader, and the
resulting function inserted as a constant into our code. Since both oddp
and truncate are built-in, it would safe to assume that we can evaluate
the compose at read-time, so long as compose itself were already loaded.

In general, composing and combining functions is more easily and
efficiently done with macros. This is particularly true in Common Lisp,
with its separate name-space for functions. After introducing macros, we
will in Chapter 15 cover much of the ground we covered here, but in a
more luxurious vehicle.

<<SEC45>>

* 6. Functions as Representation
Generally, data structures are used to represent. An array could
represent a geometric transformation; a tree could represent a hierarchy
of command; a graph could represent a rail network. In Lisp we can
sometimes use closures as a representation. Within a closure, variable
bindings can store information, and can also play the role that pointers
play in constructing complex data structures. By making a group of
closures which share bindings, or can refer to one another, we can
create hybrid objects which combine the advantages of data structures
and programs.

Beneath the surface, shared bindings are pointers. Closures just bring
us the convenience of dealing with them at a higher level of
abstraction. By using closures to represent something we would otherwise
represent with static data structures, we can often expect substantial
improvements in elegance and efficiency.

** 6.1 Networks
Closures have three useful properties: they are active, they have local
state, and we can make multiple instances of them. Where could we use
multiple copies of active objects with local state? In applications
involving networks, among others. In many cases we can represent nodes
in a network as closures. As well as having its own local state, a
closure can refer to another closure. Thus a closure representing a node
in a network can know of several other nodes (closures) to which it must
send its output. This means that we may be able to translate some
networks straight into code.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (run-node 'people)
    Is the person a man?
    >> yes
    Is he living?
    >> no
    Was he American?
    >> yes
    Is he on a coin?
    >> yes
    Is the coin a penny?
    >> yes

Figure 6.1: Session of twenty questions.

<<IDX22>>

In this section and the next we will look at two ways to traverse a
network. First we will follow the traditional approach, with nodes
defined as structures, and separate code to traverse the network. Then
in the next section we'll show how to build the same program from a
single abstraction.

As an example, we will use about the simplest application possible: one
of those programs that play twenty questions. Our network will be a
binary tree. Each non-leaf node will contain a yes/no question, and
depending on the answer to the question, the traversal will continue
down the left or right subtree. Leaf nodes will contain return values.
When the traversal reaches a leaf node, its value will be returned as
the value of the traversal. A session with this program might look as in
Figure 6.1.

The traditional way to begin would be to define some sort of data
structure to represent nodes. A node is going to have to know several
things: whether it is a leaf; if so, which value to return, and if not,
which question to ask; and where to go depending on the answer. A
sufficient data structure is defined in Figure 6.2. It is designed for
minimal size. The contents field will contain either a question or a
return value. If the node is not a leaf, the yes and no fields will tell
where to go depending on the answer to the question; if the node is a
leaf, we will know it because these fields are empty. The global *nodes*
will be a hash-table in which nodes are indexed by name. Finally,
defnode makes a new node (of either type) and stores it in *nodes*.
Using these materials we could define the first node of our tree:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defnode 'people "Is the person a man?"
      'male 'female)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defstruct node contents yes no)

    (defvar *nodes* (make-hash-table))

    (defun defnode (name conts &optional yes no)
      (setf (gethash name *nodes*)
        (make-node :contents conts
               :yes yes
               :no no)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 6.3: Sample network.

<<IDX24>>

Figure 6.3 shows as much of the network as we need to produce the
transcript in Figure 6.1.

Now all we need to do is write a function to traverse this network,
printing out the questions and following the indicated path. This
function, run-node, is shown in Figure 6.4. Given a name, we look up the
corresponding node. If it is not a leaf, the contents are asked as a
question, and depending on the answer, we continue traversing at one of
two possible destinations. If the node is a leaf, run-node just returns
its contents. With the network defined in Figure 6.3, this function
produces the output shown in Figure 6.1.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun run-node (name)
      (let ((n (gethash name *nodes*)))
        (cond ((node-yes n)
           (format t "~A~%>> " (node-contents n))
           (case (read)
             (yes (run-node (node-yes n)))
             (t (run-node (node-no n)))))
          (t (node-contents n)))))

<<Compiling Networks>><<SEC47>>

** 6.2 Compiling Networks
In the preceding section we wrote a network program as it might have
been written in any language. Indeed, the program is so simple that it
seems odd to think that we could write it any other way. But we can--in
fact, we can write it much more simply.

The code in Figure 6.5 illustrates this point. It's all we really need
to run our network. Instead of having nodes as data structures and a
separate function to traverse them, we represent the nodes as closures.
The data formerly contained in the structures gets stored in variable
bindings within the closures. Now there is no need for run-node; it is
implicit in the nodes themselves. To start the traversal, we just
funcall the node at which we want to begin:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (funcall (gethash 'people *nodes*))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Is the person a man?
    >>
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defvar *nodes* nil)

    (defun defnode (&rest args)
      (push args *nodes*)
      args)

    (defun compile-net (root)
      (let ((node (assoc root *nodes*)))
        (if (null node)
        nil
          (let ((conts (second node))
            (yes (third node))
            (no (fourth node)))
        (if yes
            (let ((yes-fn (compile-net yes))
              (no-fn (compile-net no)))
              #'(lambda ()
              (format t "~A~%>> " conts)
              (funcall (if (eq (read) 'yes)
                       yes-fn
                     no-fn))))
          #'(lambda () conts))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 6.6: Compilation with static references.

<<IDX27>>

From then on, the transcript will be just as it was with the previous
implementation.

By representing the nodes as closures, we are able to transform our
twenty-questions network entirely into code. As it is, the code will
have to look up the node functions by name at runtime. However, if we
know that the network is not going to be redefined on the fly, we can
add a further enhancement: we can have node functions call their
destinations directly, without having to go through a hash-table.

Figure 6.6 contains a new version of the program. Now *nodes* is a
disposable list instead of a hash-table. All the nodes are defined with
defnode as before, but no closures are generated at this point. After
all the nodes have been defined, we call compile-net to compile a whole
network at once. This function recursively works its way right down to
the leaves of the tree, and on the way back up, returns at each step the
node/function for each of the two subtrees. [fn:14] So now
each node will have a direct handle on its two destinations, instead of
having only their names. When the original call to compile-net returns,
it will yield a function representing the portion of the network we
asked to have compiled.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq n (compile-net 'people))
    #<Compiled-Function BF3C06>
    > (funcall n)
    Is the person a man?
    >>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notice that compile-net compiles in both senses. It compiles in the
general sense, by translating the abstract representation of the network
into code. Moreover, if compile-net itself is compiled, it will return
compiled functions. (See page 25.)

After compiling the network, we will no longer need the list made by
defnode. It can be cut loose (e.g. by setting *nodes* to nil) and
reclaimed by the garbage collector.

<<Looking Forward>><<SEC48>>

** 6.3 Looking Forward
Many programs involving networks can be implemented by compiling the
nodes into closures. Closures are data objects, and they can be used to
represent things just as structures can. Doing so requires some
unconventional thinking, but the rewards are faster and more elegant
programs.

Macros help substantially when we use closures as a representation. "To
represent with closures" is another way of saying "to compile," and
since macros do their work at compile-time, they are a natural vehicle
for this technique. After macros have been introduced, Chapters 23 and
24 will present much larger programs based on the strategy used here.
* 7. Macros
Lisp's macro facility allows you to define operators that are
implemented by transformation. The definition of a macro is essentially
a function that generates Lisp code--a program that writes programs.
From these small beginnings arise great possibilities, and also
unexpected hazards. Chapters 7--10 form a tutorial on macros. This
chapter explains how macros work, gives techniques for writing and
testing them, and looks at the issue of macro style.

** 7.1 How Macros Work
Since macros can be called and return values, they tend to be associated
with functions. Macro definitions sometimes resemble function
definitions, and speaking informally, people call do, which is actually
a macro, a "built-in function." But pushing the analogy too far can be a
source of confusion. Macros work differently from normal functions, and
knowing how and why macros are different is the key to using them
correctly. A function produces results, but a macro produces
expressions--which, when evaluated, produce results.

The best way to begin is to move straight into an example. Suppose we
want to write a macro nil!, which sets its argument to nil. We want
(nil! x) to have the same effect as (setq x nil). We do it by defining
nil! as a macro which turns instances of the first form into instances
of the second.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (defmacro nil! (var)
    (list 'setq var nil))
    NIL!
    82
#+END_EXAMPLE

Paraphrased in English, this definition tells Lisp: "Whenever you see an
expression of the form (nil! var), turn it into one of the form (setq
var nil) before evaluating it."

The expression generated by the macro will be evaluated in place of the
original macro call. A macro call is a list whose first element is the
name of a macro. What happens when we type the macro call (nil! x) into
the toplevel? Lisp notices that nil! is the name of a macro, and

1. builds the expression specified by the definition above, then
2. evaluates that expression in place of the original macro call.

The step of building the new expression is called macroexpansion. Lisp
looks up the definition of nil!, which shows how to construct a
replacement for the macro call. The definition of nil! is applied like a
function to the expressions given as arguments in the macro call. It
returns a list of three elements: setq, the expression given as the
argument to the macro, and nil. In this case, the argument to nil! is x,
and the macroexpansion is (setq x nil).

After macroexpansion comes a second step, evaluation. Lisp evaluates the
macroexpansion (setq x nil) as if you had typed that in the first place.
Evaluation does not always come immediately after expansion, as it does
at the toplevel. A macro call occurring in the definition of a function
will be expanded when the function is compiled, but the expansion--or
the object code which results from it--won't be evaluated until the
function is called.

Many of the difficulties you might encounter with macros can be avoided
by maintaining a sharp distinction between macroexpansion and
evaluation. When writing macros, know which computations are performed
during macroexpansion, and which during evaluation, for the two steps
generally operate on objects of two different sorts. The macroexpansion
step deals with expressions, and the evaluation step deals with their
values.

Sometimes macroexpansioncan be more complicated than it was in the case
of nil!. The expansion of nil! was a call to a built-in special form,
but sometimes the expansion of a macro will be yet another macro call,
like a Russian doll which contains another doll inside it. In such
cases, macroexpansion simply continues until it arrives at an expression
which is no longer a macro call. The process can take arbitrarily many
steps, so long as it terminates eventually.

Many languages offer some form of macro, but Lisp macros are singularly
powerful. When a file of Lisp is compiled, a parser reads the source
code and sends its output to the compiler. Here's the stroke of genius:
the output of the parser consists of lists of Lisp objects. With macros,
we can manipulate the program while it's in this intermediate form
between parser and compiler. If necessary, these manipulations can be
very extensive. A macro generating its expansion has at its disposition
the full power of Lisp. Indeed, a macro is really a Lisp function--- one
which happens to return expressions. The definition of nil! contains a
single call to list, but another macro might invoke a whole subprogram
to generate its expansion.

Being able to change what the compiler sees is almost like being able to
rewrite it. We can add any construct to the language that we can define
by transformation into existing constructs.

<<Backquote>><<SEC51>>

** 7.2 Backquote
Backquote is a special version of quote which can be used to create
templates for Lisp expressions. One of the most common uses of backquote
is in macro definitions.

The backquote character, `, is so named because it resembles a regular
quote, ', reversed. When backquote alone is affixed to an expression, it
behaves just like quote:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    `(a b c) is equal to '(a b c).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Backquote becomes useful only when it appears in combination with comma,
,, and comma-at, ,. If backquote makes a template, comma makes a slot
within a template. A backquoted list is equivalent to a call to list
with the elements quoted. That is,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    `(a b c) is equal to (list 'a 'b 'c).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Within the scope of a backquote, a comma tells Lisp: "turn off the
quoting." When a comma appears before one of the elements of the list,
it has the effect of cancelling out the quote that would have been put
there. So

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    `(a ,b c ,d) is equal to (list 'a b 'c d).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Instead of the symbol b, its value is inserted into the resulting list.
Commas work no matter how deeply they appear within a nested list,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq a 1 b 2 c 3)
    3
    > `(a ,b c)
    (A 2 C)
    > `(a (,b c))
    (A (2 C))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and they may even appear within quotes, or within quoted sublists:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > `(a b ,c (',(+ a b c)) (+ a b) 'c '((,a ,b)))
    (A B 3 ('6) (+ A B) 'C '((1 2)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

One comma counteracts the effect of one backquote, so commas must match
backquotes. Say that a comma is surrounded by a particular operator if
the operator is prepended to the comma, or prepended to an expression
which contains it. In `(,a ,(b `,c))), for example, the last comma is
surrounded by one comma and two backquotes. The general rule is: a comma
surrounded by n commas must be surrounded by at least n+1 backquotes. An
obvious corollary is that commas may not appear outside of a backquoted
expression. Backquotes and commas can be nested, so long as they obey
the rule above. Any of the following expressions would generate an error
if typed into the toplevel:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ,x `(a ,,b c) `(a ,(b ,c) d) `(,,`a)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Nested backquotes are only likely to be needed in macro-defining macros.
Both topics are discussed in Chapter 16.

Backquote is usually used for making lists.[fn:15] Any list
generated by backquote can also be generated by using list and regular
quotes. The advantage of backquote is just that it makes expressions
easier to read, because a backquoted expression resembles the expression
it will produce. In the previous section we defined nil! as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro nil! (var)
      (list 'setq var nil))
#+END_EXAMPLE

With backquote the same macro can be defined as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro nil! (var)
      `(setq ,var nil))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which in this case is not all that different. The longer the macro
definition, however, the more important it is to use backquote. Figure
7.1 contains two possible definitions of nif, a macro which does a
three-way numeric if.[fn:16]

The first argument should evaluate to a number. Then the second, third,
or fourth argument is evaluated, depending on whether the first was
positive, zero, or negative:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapcar #'(lambda (x)
    (nif x 'p 'z 'n))
    '(0 2.5 -8))
    (Z P N)
#+END_EXAMPLE

With backquote:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro nif (expr pos zero neg)
      `(case (truncate (signum ,expr))
         (1 ,pos)
         (0 ,zero)
         (-1 ,neg)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Without backquote:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro nif (expr pos zero neg)
      (list 'case
        (list 'truncate (list 'signum expr))
        (list 1 pos)
        (list 0 zero)
        (list -1 neg)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 7.1: A macro defined with and without backquote.

<<IDX28>>

The two definitions in Figure 7.1 define the same macro, but the first
uses backquote, while the second builds its expansion by explicit calls
to list. From the first definition it's easy to see that (nif x 'p 'z
'n), for example, expands into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (case (truncate (signum x))
      (1 'p)
      (0 'z)
      (-1 'n))
#+END_EXAMPLE

because the body of the macro definition looks just like the expansion
it generates. To understand the second version, without backquote, you
have to trace in your head the building of the expansion.

Comma-at, ,@, is a variant of comma. It behaves like comma, with one
difference: instead of merely inserting the value of the expression to
which it is affixed, as comma does, comma-at splices it. Splicing can be
thought of as inserting while removing the outermost level of
parentheses:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq b '(1 2 3))
    (1 2 3)
    > `(a ,b c)
    (A (1 2 3) C)
    > `(a ,@b c)
    (A 1 2 3 C)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The comma causes the list (1 2 3) to be inserted in place of b, while
the comma-at causes the elements of the list to be inserted there. There
are some additional restrictions on the use of comma-at:

1. In order for its argument to be spliced, comma-at must occur within a
   sequence. It's an error to say something like `,@b because there is
   nowhere to splice the value of b.
2. The object to be spliced must be a list, unless it occurs last. The
   expression `(a ,@1) will evaluate to (a . 1), but attempting to
   splice an atom into the middle of a list, as in `(a ,@1 b), will
   cause an error.

Comma-at tends to be used in macros which take an indeterminate number
of arguments and pass them on to functions or macros which also take an
indeterminate number of arguments. This situation commonly arises when
implementing implicit blocks. Common Lisp has several operators for
grouping code into blocks, including block, tagbody, and progn. These
operators rarely appear directly in source code; they are more often
implicit--that is, hidden by macros.

An implicit block occurs in any built-in macro which can have a body of
expressions. Both let and cond provide implicit progn, for example. The
simplest built-in macro to do so is probably when:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (when (eligible obj)
      (do-this)
      (do-that)
      obj)
#+END_EXAMPLE

If (eligible obj) returns true, the remaining expressions will be
evaluated, and the when expression as a whole will return the value of
the last. As an example of the use of comma-at, here is one possible
definition for when:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro our-when (test &body body)
      `(if ,test
           (progn
         ,@body)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This definition uses an &body parameter (identical to &rest except for
its effect on pretty-printing) to take in an arbitrary number of
arguments, and a comma-at to splice them into a progn expression. In the
macroexpansion of the call above, the three expressions in the body will
appear within a single progn:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (if (eligible obj)
        (progn (do-this)
           (do-that)
           obj))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Most macros for iteration splice their arguments in a similar way.

The effect of comma-at can be achieved without using backquote. The
expression `(a ,@b c) is equal to (cons 'a (append b (list 'c))), for
example. Comma-at exists only to make such expression-generating
expressions more readable.

Macro definitions (usually) generate lists. Although macro expansions
could be built with the function list, backquote list-templates make the
task much easier. A macro defined with defmacroand backquote will
superficially resemble a function defined with defun. So long as you are
not misled by the similarity, backquote makes macro definitions both
easier to write and easier to read.

Backquote is so often used in macro definitions that people sometimes
think of backquote as part of defmacro. The last thing to remember about
backquote is that it has a life of its own, separate from its role in
macros. You can use backquote anywhere sequences need to be built:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun greet (name)
      `(hello ,name))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<Defining Simple Macros>><<SEC52>>

** 7.3 Defining Simple Macros
In programming, the best way to learn is often to begin experimenting as
soon as possible. A full theoretical understanding can come later.
Accordingly, this section presents a way to start writing macros
immediately. It works only for a narrow range of cases, but where
applicable it can be applied quite mechanically. (If you've written
macros before, you may want to skip this section.)

As an example, we consider how to write a variant of the the built-in
Common Lisp function member. By default member uses eql to test for
equality. If you want to test for membership using eq, you have to say
so explicitly:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (member x choices :test #'eq)
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we did this a lot, we might want to write a variant of member which
always used eq. Some earlier dialects of Lisp had such a function,
called memq: (memq x choices) Ordinarily one would define memq as an
inline function, but for the sake of example we will reincarnate it as a
macro.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    call: (memq x choices)
    expansion: (member x choices :test #'eq)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 7.2: Diagram used in writing memq.

<<IDX29>>

The method: Begin with a typical call to the macro you want to define.
Write it down on a piece of paper, and below it write down the
expression into which it ought to expand. Figure 7.2 shows two such
expressions. From the macro call, construct the parameter list for your
macro, making up some parameter name for each of the arguments. In this
case there are two arguments, so we'll have two parameters, and call
them obj and lst:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro memq (obj lst)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now go back to the two expressions you wrote down. For each argument in
the macro call, draw a line connecting it with the place it appears in
the expansion below. In Figure 7.2 there are two parallel lines. To
write the body of the macro, turn your attention to the expansion. Start
the body with a backquote. Now, begin reading the expansion expression
by expression. Wherever you find a parenthesis that isn't part of an
argument in the macro call, put one in the macro definition. So
following the backquote will be a left parenthesis. For each expression
in the expansion

1. If there is no line connecting it with the macro call, then write
   down the expression itself.
2. If there is a connection to one of the arguments in the macro call,
   write down the symbol which occurs in the corresponding position in
   the macro parameter list, preceded by a comma.

There is no connection to the first element, member, so we use member
itself:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro memq (obj lst)
      `(member
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, x has a line leading to the first argument in the source
expression, so we use in the macro body the first parameter, with a
comma:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro memq (obj lst)
      `(member ,obj
#+END_EXAMPLE

Continuing in this way, the completed macro definition is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro memq (obj lst)
      `(member ,obj ,lst :test #'eq))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (while hungry
      (stare-intently)
      (meow)
      (rub-against-legs))

    (do ()
        ((not hungry))
      (stare-intently)
      (meow)
      (rub-against-legs))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 7.3: Diagram used in writing while.

<<IDX30>>

So far, we can only write macros which take a fixed number of arguments.
Now suppose we want to write a macro while, which will take a test
expression and some body of code, and loop through the code as long as
the test expression returns true. Figure 7.3 contains an example of a
while loop describing the behavior of a cat.

To write such a macro, we have to modify our technique slightly. As
before, begin by writing down a sample macro call. From that, build the
parameter list of the macro, but where you want to take an indefinite
number of arguments, conclude with an &rest or &body parameter:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro while (test &body body)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now write the desired expansion below the macro call, and as before draw
lines connecting the arguments in the macro call to their position in
the expansion. However, when you have a sequence of arguments which are
going to be sucked into a single &rest or &body parameter, treat them as
a group, drawing a single line for the whole sequence. Figure 7.3 shows
the resulting diagram.

To write the body of the macro definition, proceed as before along the
expansion. As well as the two previous rules, we need one more:

3. If there is a connection from a series of expressions in the
expansion to a series of the arguments in the macro call, write down the
corresponding &rest or &body parameter, preceded by a comma-at. So the
resulting macro definition will be:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro while (test &body body)
      `(do ()
           ((not ,test))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

To build a macro which can have a body of expressions, some parameter
has to act as a funnel. Here multiple arguments in the macro call are
joined together into body, and then broken up again when body is spliced
into the expansion.

The approach described in this section enables us to write the simplest
macros--those which merely shuffle their parameters. Macros can do a lot
more than that. Section 7.7 will present examples where expansions can't
be represented as simple backquoted lists, and to generate them, macros
become programs in their own right.

<<Testing Macroexpansion>><<SEC53>>

** 7.4 Testing Macroexpansion
Having written a macro, how do we test it? A macro like memq is simple
enough that one can tell just by looking at it what it will do. When
writing more complicated macros, we have to be able to check that they
are being expanded correctly.

Figure 7.4 shows a macro definition and two ways of looking at its
expansion. The built-in function macroexpand takes an expression and
returns its macroexpansion. Sending a macro call to macroexpand shows
how the macro call will finally be expanded before being evaluated, but
a complete expansion is not always what you want in order to test a
macro. When the macro in question relies on other macros, they too will
be expanded, so a complete macroexpansion can sometimes be difficult to
read.

From the first expression shown in Figure 7.4, it's hard to tell whether
or not while is expanding as intended, because the built-in do macro
gets expanded, as well as the prog macro into which it expands. What we
need is a way of seeing the result after only one step of expansion.
This is the purpose of the built-in function macroexpand-1, shown in the
second example; macroexpand-1 stops after just one step, even if the
expansion is still a macro call.

When we want to look at the expansion of a macro call, it will be a
nuisance always to have to type

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (pprint (macroexpand-1 '(or x y)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 7.5 defines a new macro which allows us to say instead.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mac (or x y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (defmacro while (test &body body)
    `(do ()
    ((not ,test))
    ,@body))
    WHILE
    > (pprint (macroexpand '(while (able) (laugh))))
    (BLOCK NIL
    (LET NIL
    (TAGBODY
    #:G61
    (IF (NOT (ABLE)) (RETURN NIL))
    (LAUGH)
    (GO #:G61))))
    T
    > (pprint (macroexpand-1 '(while (able) (laugh))))
    (DO NIL
    ((NOT (ABLE)))
    (LAUGH))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

      `(pprint (macroexpand-1 ',expr)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<IDX32>>

Typically you debug functions by calling them, and macros by expanding
them. But since a macro call involves two layers of computation, there
are two points where things can go wrong. If a macro is misbehaving,
most of the time you will be able to tell what's wrong just by looking
at the expansion. Sometimes, though, the expansion will look fine and
you'll want to evaluate it to see where the problems arise. If the
expansion contains free variables, you may want to set some variables
first. In some systems, you will be able to copy the expansion and paste
it into the toplevel, or select it and choose eval from a menu. In the
worst case you can set a variable to the list returned by macroexpand-1,
then call eval on it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq exp (macroexpand-1 '(memq 'a '(a b c))))
    (MEMBER (QUOTE A) (QUOTE (A B C)) :TEST (FUNCTION EQ))
    > (eval exp)
    (A B C)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, macroexpansion is more than an aid in debugging, it's also a
way of learning how to write macros. Common Lisp has over a hundred
macros built-in, some of them quite complex. By looking at the
expansions of these macros you will often be able to see how they were
written.

<<Destructuring in Parameter Lists>><<SEC54>>

** 7.5 Destructuring in Parameter Lists
Destructuring is a generalization of the sort of assignment 3 done by
function calls. If you define a function of several arguments

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun foo (x y z)
      (+ x y z))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then when the function is called

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (foo 1 2 3)
#+END_EXAMPLE

the parameters of the function are assigned arguments in the call
according to their position: x to 1, y to 2, and z to 3. Destructuring
describes the situation where this sort of positional assignment is done
for arbitrary list structures, as well as flat lists like (x y z).

The Common Lisp destructuring-bind macro (new in CLTL2) takes a pattern,
an argument evaluating to a list, and a body of expressions, and
evaluates the expressions with the parameters in the pattern bound to
the corresponding elements of the list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (destructuring-bind (x (y) . z) '(a (b) c d)
    (list x y z))
    (A B (C D))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This new operator and others like it form the subject of Chapter 18.

Destructuring is also possible in macro parameter lists. The Common Lisp
defmacro allows parameter lists to be arbitrary list structures. When a
macro call is expanded, components of the call will be assigned to the
parameters as if by destructuring-bind. The built-in dolist macro takes
advantage of such parameter list destructuring. In a call like:

3 Destructuring is usually seen in operators which create bindings,
rather than do assignments. However, conceptually destructuring is a way
of assigning values, and would work just as well for existing variables
as for new ones. That is, there is nothing to stop you from writing a
destructuring setq.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (dolist (x '(a b c))
      (print x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

the expansion function must pluck x and '(a b c) from within the list
given as the first argument. That can be done implicitly by giving
dolist the appropriate parameter list:[fn:17]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro our-dolist ((var list &optional result) &body body)
      `(progn
         (mapc #'(lambda (,var) ,@body)
           ,list)
         (let ((,var nil))
           ,result)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

In Common Lisp, macros like dolist usually enclose within a list the
arguments not part of the body. Because it takes an optional result
argument, dolist must enclose its first arguments in a distinct list
anyway. But even if the extra list structure were not necessary, it
would make calls to dolist easier to read. Suppose we want to define a
macro when-bind, like when except that it binds some variable to the
value returned by the test expression. This macro may be best
implemented with a nested parameter list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro when-bind ((var expr) &body body)
      `(let ((,var ,expr))
         (when ,var
           ,@body)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and called as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (when-bind (input (get-user-input))
           (process input))
#+END_EXAMPLE

instead of:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((input (get-user-input)))
      (when input
        (process input)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Used sparingly, parameter list destructuring can result in clearer code.
At a minimum, it can be used in macros like when-bind and dolist, which
take two or more arguments followed by a body of expressions.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro our-expander (name) `(get ,name 'expander))

    (defmacro our-defmacro (name parms &body body)
      (let ((g (gensym)))
        `(progn
           (setf (our-expander ',name)
             #'(lambda (,g)
             (block ,name
               (destructuring-bind ,parms (cdr ,g)
                 ,@body))))
           ',name)))

    (defun our-macroexpand-1 (expr)
      (if (and (consp expr) (our-expander (car expr)))
          (funcall (our-expander (car expr)) expr)
        expr))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 7.6: A sketch of defmacro.

<<IDX33>>

<<A Model of Macros>><<SEC55>>

** 7.6 A Model of Macros
A formal description of what macros dowouldbe long and confusing.
Experienced programmers do not carry such a description in their heads
anyway. It's more convenient to remember what defmacro does by imagining
how it would be defined.

There is a long tradition of such explanations in Lisp. The Lisp 1.5
Programmer's Manual, first published in 1962, gives for reference a
definition of eval written in Lisp. Since defmacro is itself a macro, we
can give it the same treatment, as in Figure 7.6. This definition uses
several techniques which haven't been covered yet, so some readers may
want to refer to it later.

The definition in Figure 7.6 gives a fairly accurate impression of what
macros do, but like any sketch it is incomplete. It wouldn't handle the
&whole keyword properly. And what defmacro really stores as the
macro-function of its first argument is a function of two arguments: the
macro call, and the lexical environment in which it occurs. However,
these features are used only by the most esoteric macros. If you worked
on the assumption that macros were implemented as in Figure 7.6, you
would hardly ever go wrong. Every macro defined in this book would work,
for example. The definition in Figure 7.6 yields an expansion function
which is a sharp-quoted lambda-expression. That should make it a
closure: any free symbols in the macro definition should refer to
variables in the environment where the defmacro occurred. So it should
be possible to say this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((op 'setq))
      (defmacro our-setq (var val)
        (list op var val)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

As of CLTL2, it is. But in CLTL1, macro expanders were defined in the
null lexical environment,[fn:18] so in some old
implementations this definition of our-setq will not work.

<<Macros as Programs>><<SEC56>>

** 7.7 Macros as Programs
A macro definition need not be just a backquoted list. A macro is a
function which transforms one sort of expression into another. This
function can call list to generate its result, but can just as well
invoke a whole subprogram consisting of hundreds of lines of code.

Section 7.3 gave an easy way of writing macros. Using this technique we
can write macros whose expansions contain the same subexpressions as
appear in the macro call. Unfortunately, only the simplest macros meet
this condition. As a more complicated example, consider the built-in
macro do. It isn't possible to write do as a macro which simply shuffles
its parameters. The expansion has to build complex expressions which
never appear in the macro call.

The more general approach to writing macros is to think about the sort
of expression you want to be able to use, what you want it to expand
into, and then write the program that will transform the first form into
the second. Try expanding an example by hand, then look at what happens
when one form is transformed into another. By working from examples you
can get an idea of what will be required of your proposed macro.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (do ((w 3)
         (x 1 (1+ x))
         (y 2 (1+ y))
         (z))
        ((> x 10) (princ z) y)
      (princ x)
      (princ y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

should expand into something like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (prog ((w 3) (x 1) (y 2) (z nil))
          foo
          (if (> x 10)
          (return (progn (princ z) y)))
          (princ x)
          (princ y)
          (psetq x (1+ x) y (1+ y))
          (go foo))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 7.7: Desired expansion of do.

<<IDX34>>

Figure 7.7 shows an instance of do, and the expression into which it
should expand. Doing expansions by hand is a good way to clarify your
ideas about how a macro should work. For example, it may not be obvious
until one tries writing the expansion that the local variables will have
to be updated using psetq.

The built-in macro psetq (named for "parallel setq") behaves like setq,
except that all its (even-numbered) arguments will be evaluated before
any of the assignments are made. If an ordinary setq has more than two
arguments, then the new value of the first argument is visible during
the evaluation of the fourth:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((a 1))
    (setq a 2 b a)
    (list a b))
    (2 2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here, because a is set first, b gets its new value, 2. A psetq is
supposed to behave as if its arguments were assigned in parallel:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((a 1))
    (psetq a 2 b a)
    (list a b))
    (2 1)
#+END_EXAMPLE

So here b gets the old value of a. The psetq macro is provided
especially to support macros like do, which need to evaluate some of
their arguments in parallel. (Had we used setq, we would have been
defining do* instead.)

On looking at the expansion, it is also clear that we can't really use
foo as the loop label. What if foo is also used as a loop label within
the body of the do? Chapter 9 will deal with this problem in detail; for
now, suffice it to say that instead of using foo, the macroexpansion
must use a special anonymous symbol returned by the function gensym.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro our-do (bindforms (test &rest result) &body body)
      (let ((label (gensym)))
        `(prog ,(make-initforms bindforms)
           ,label
           (if ,test
               (return (progn ,@result)))
           ,@body
           (psetq ,@(make-stepforms bindforms))
           (go ,label))))

    (defun make-initforms (bindforms)
      (mapcar #'(lambda (b)
              (if (consp b)
              (list (car b) (cadr b))
            (list b nil)))
          bindforms))

    (defun make-stepforms (bindforms)
      (mapcan #'(lambda (b)
              (if (and (consp b) (third b))
              (list (car b) (third b))
            nil))
          bindforms))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 7.8: Implementing do.

<<IDX35>>

In order to write do, we consider what it would take to transform the
first expression in Figure 7.7 into the second. To perform such a
transformation, we need to do more than get the macro parameters into
the right positions in some backquoted list. The initial prog has to be
followed by a list of symbols and their initial bindings, which must be
extracted from the second argument passed to the do. The function
make-initforms in Figure 7.8 will return such a list. We also have to
build a list of arguments for the psetq, but this case is more
complicated because not all the symbols should be updated. In Figure
7.8, make-stepforms returns arguments for the psetq. With these two
functions, the rest of the definition becomes fairly straightforward.

The code in Figure 7.8 isn't exactly the way do would be written in a
real implementation. To emphasize the computation done during expansion,
make-initforms and make-stepforms have been broken out as separate
functions. In the future, such code will usually be left within the
defmacroexpression.

With the definition of this macro, we begin to see what macros can do. A
macro has full access to Lisp to build an expansion. The code used to
generate the expansion may be a program in its own right.

<<Macro Style>><<SEC57>>

** 7.8 Macro Style
Good style means something different for macros. Style matters when code
is either read by people or evaluated by Lisp. With macros, both of
these activities take place under slightly unusual circumstances.

There are two different kinds of code associated with a macro
definition: expander code, the code used by the macro to generate its
expansion, and expansion code, which appears in the expansion itself.
The principles of style are different for each. For programs in general,
to have good style is to be clear and efficient. These principles are
bent in opposite directions by the two types of macro code: expander
code can favor clarity over efficiency, and expansion code can favor
efficiency over clarity.

It's in compiled code that efficiency counts most, and in compiled code
the macro calls have already been expanded. If the expander code was
efficient, it made compilation go slightly faster, but it won't make any
difference in how well the program runs. Since the expansion of macro
calls tends to be only a small part of the work done by a compiler,
macros which expand efficiently can't usually make much of a difference
even in the compilation speed. So most of the time you can safely write
expander code the way you would write a quick, first version of a
program. If the expander code does unnecessary work or conses a lot, so
what? Your time is better spent improving other parts of the program.
Certainly if there's a choice between clarity and speed in expander
code, clarity should prevail. Macro definitions are generally harder to
read than function definitions, because they contain a mix of
expressions evaluated at two different times. If this confusion can be
reduced at the expense of efficiency in the expander code, it's a
bargain.

For example, suppose that we wanted to define a version of and as a
macro. Since (and a b c) is equivalent to (if a (if b c)), we can write
and in terms of if as in the first definition in Figure 7.9. According
to the standards by which we judge ordinary code, our-and is badly
written. The expander code is recursive, and on each recursion finds the
length of successive cdrs of the same list. If this code were going to
be evaluated at runtime, it would be better to define this macro as in
our-andb, which generates the same expansion with no wasted effort.
However, as a macro definition our-and is just as good, if not better.
It may be inefficient in calling length on each recursion, but its
organization shows more clearly the way in which the expansion depends
on the number of conjuncts.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro our-and (&rest args)
      (case (length args)
        (0 t)
        (1 (car args))
        (t `(if ,(car args)
            (our-and ,@(cdr args))))))

    (defmacro our-andb (&rest args)
      (if (null args)
          t
        (labels ((expander (rest)
                   (if (cdr rest)
                   `(if ,(car rest)
                    ,(expander (cdr rest)))
                 (car rest))))
          (expander args))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 7.9: Two macros equivalent to and.

<<IDX36>>

As always, there are exceptions. In Lisp, the distinction between
compile-time and runtime is an artificial one, so any rule which depends
upon it is likewise artificial. In some programs, compile-time is
runtime. If you're writing a program whose main purpose is
transformation and which uses macros to do it, then everything changes:
the expander code becomes your program, and the expansion its output. Of
course under such circumstances expander code should be written with
efficiency in mind. However, it's safe to say that most expander code
(a) only affects the speed of compilation, and (b) doesn't affect it
very much--meaning that clarity should nearly always come first.

With expansion code, it's just the opposite. Clarity matters less for
macro expansions because they are rarely looked at, especially by other
people. The forbidden goto is not entirely forbidden in expansions, and
the disparaged setq not quite so disparaged.

Proponents of structured programming disliked goto for what it did to
source code. It was not machine language jump instructions that they
considered harmful--so long as they were hidden by more abstract
constructs in source code. Gotos are condemned in Lisp precisely because
it's so easy to hide them: you can use do instead, and if you didn't
have do, you could write it. Of course, if we're going to build new
abstractions on top of goto, the goto is going to have to exist
somewhere. Thus it is not necessarily bad style to use go in the
definition of a new macro, if it can't be written in terms of some
existing macro.

Similarly, setq is frowned upon because it makes it hard to see where a
given variable gets its value. However, a macroexpansion is not going to
be read by many people, so there is usually little harm in using setq on
variables created within the macroexpansion. If you look at expansions
of some of the built-in macros, you'll see quite a lot of setqs.

Several circumstances can make clarity more important in expansion code.
If you're writing a complicated macro, you may end up reading the
expansions after all, at least while you're debugging it. Also, in
simple macros, only a backquote separates expander code from expansion
code, so if such macros generate ugly expansions, the ugliness will be
all too visible in your source code. However, even when the clarity of
expansion code becomes an issue, efficiency should still predominate.
Efficiency is important in most runtime code. Two things make it
especially so for macro expansions: their ubiquity and their
invisibility.

Macros are often used to implement general-purpose utilities, which are
then called everywhere in a program. Something used so often can't
afford to be inefficient. What looks like a harmless little macro could,
after the expansion of all the calls to it, amount to a significant
proportion of your program. Such a macro should receive more attention
than its length would seem to demand. Avoid consing especially. A
utility which conses unnecessarily can ruin the performance of an
otherwise efficient program.

The other reason to look to the efficiency of expansion code is its very
invisibility. If a function is badly implemented, it will proclaim this
fact to you every time you look at its definition. Not so with macros.
From a macro definition, inefficiency in the expansion code may not be
evident, which is all the more reason to go looking for it.

<<Dependence on Macros>><<SEC58>>

** 7.9 Dependence on Macros
If you redefine a function, other functions which call it will
automatically get the new version.[fn:19] The same doesn't
always hold for macros. A macro call which occurs in a function
definition gets replaced by its expansion when the function is compiled.
What if we redefine the macro after the calling function has been
compiled? Since no trace of the original macro call remains, the
expansion within the function can't be updated. The behavior of the
function will continue to reflect the old macro definition:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (defmacro mac (x) `(1+ ,x))
    MAC
    > (setq fn (compile nil '(lambda (y) (mac y))))
    #<Compiled-Function BF7E7E>
    > (defmacro mac (x) `(+ ,x 100))
    MAC
    > (funcall fn 1)
    2
#+END_EXAMPLE

Similar problems occur if code which calls some macro is compiled before
the macro itself is defined. CLTL2 says that "a macro definition must be
seen by the compiler before the first use of the macro." Implementations
vary in how they respond to violations of this rule. Fortunately it's
easy to avoid both types of problem. If you adhere to the following two
principles, you need never worry about stale or nonexistent macro
definitions:

1. Define macros before functions (or macros) which call them.
2. When a macro is redefined, also recompile all the functions (or
   macros) which call it--directly or via other macros.

It has been suggested that all the macros in a program be put in a
separate file, to make it easier to ensure that macro definitions are
compiled first. That's taking things too far. It would be reasonable to
put general-purpose macros like while into a separate file, but
general-purpose utilities ought to be separated from the rest of a
program anyway, whether they're functions or macros.

Some macros are written just for use in one specific part of a program,
and these should be defined with the code which uses them. So long as
the definition of each macro appears before any calls to it, your
programs will compile fine. Collecting together all your macros, simply
because they're macros, would do nothing but make your code harder to
read.

<<Macros from Functions>><<SEC59>>

** 7.10 Macros from Functions
This section describes how to transform functions into macros. The first
step in translating a function into a macro is to ask yourself if you
really need to do it. Couldn't you just as well declare the function
inline (p. 26)?

There are some legitimate reasons to consider how to translate functions
into macros, though. When you begin writing macros, it sometimes helps
to think as if you were writing a function--an approach that usually
yields macros which aren't quite right, but which at least give you
something to work from. Another reason to look at the relationship
between macros and functions is to see how they differ. Finally, Lisp
programmers sometimes actually want to convert functions into macros.

The difficulty of translating a function into a macro depends on a
number of properties of the function. The easiest class to translate are
the functions which

1. Have a body consisting of a single expression.
2. Have a parameter list consisting only of parameter names.
3. Create no new variables (except the parameters).
4. Are not recursive (nor part of a mutually recursive group).
5. Have no parameter which occurs more than once in the body.
6. Have no parameter whose value is used before that of another
   parameter occurring before it in the parameter list.
7. Contain no free variables.

One function which meets these criteria is the built-in Common Lisp
function second, which returns the second element of a list. It could be
defined:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun second (x) (cadr x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where a function definition meets all the conditions above, you can
easily transform it into an equivalent macro definition. Simply put a
backquote in front of the body and a comma in front of each symbol which
occurs in the parameter list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro second (x) `(cadr ,x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Of course, the macro can't be called under all the same conditions. It
can't be given as the first argument to apply or funcall, and it should
not be called in environments where the functions it calls have new
local bindings. For ordinary in-line calls, though, the macro second
should do the same thing as the function second.

The technique changes slightly when the body has more than one
expression, because a macro must expand into a single expression. So if
condition 1 doesn't hold, you have to add a progn. The function
noisy-second:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun noisy-second (x)
      (princ "Someone is taking a cadr!")
      (cadr x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

could be duplicated by the following macro:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro noisy-second (x)
      `(progn
         (princ "Someone is taking a cadr!")
         (cadr ,x)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

When the function doesn't meet condition 2 because it has an &rest or
&body parameter, the rules are the same, except that the parameter,
instead of simply having a comma before it, must be spliced into a call
to list. Thus

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun sum (&rest args)
      (apply #'+ args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

becomes

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro sum (&rest args)
      `(apply #'+ (list ,@args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which in this case would be better rewritten:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro sum (&rest args)
      `(+ ,@args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

When condition 3 doesn't hold--when new variables are created within the
function body--the rule about the insertion of commas must be modified.
Instead of putting commas before all symbols in the parameter list, we
only put them before those which will refer to the parameters. For
example, in:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun foo (x y z)
      (list x (let ((x y))
            (list x z))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

neither of the last two instances of x will refer to the parameter x.
The second instance is not evaluated at all, and the third instance
refers to a new variable established by the let. So only the first
instance will get a comma:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro foo (x y z)
      `(list ,x (let ((x ,y))
              (list x ,z))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Functions can sometimes be transformed into macros when conditions 4, 5
and 6 don't hold. However, these topics are treated separately in later
chapters. The issue of recursion in macros is covered in Section 10.4,
and the dangers of multiple and misordered evaluation in Sections 10.1
and 10.2, respectively.

As for condition 7, it is possible to simulate closures with macros,
using a technique similar to the error described on page 37. But seeing
as this is a low hack, not consonant with the genteel tone of this book,
we shall not go into details.

<<Symbol Macros>><<SEC60>>

** 7.11 Symbol Macros
CLTL2 introduced a new kind of macro into Common Lisp, the symbol-macro.
While a normal macro call looks like a function call, a symbol-macro
"call" looks like a symbol.

Symbol-macros can only be locally defined. The symbol-macrolet special
form can, within its body, cause a lone symbol to behave like an
expression:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (symbol-macrolet ((hi (progn (print "Howdy")
    1)))
    (+ hi 2))
    "Howdy"
    3
#+END_EXAMPLE

The body of the symbol-macrolet will be evaluated as if every hi in
argument position had been replaced with (progn (print "Howdy") 1).

Conceptually, symbol-macros are like macros that don't take any
arguments. With no arguments,macros become simply textual abbreviations.
This is not to say that symbol-macros are useless, however. They are
used in Chapter 15 (page 205) and Chapter 18 (page 237), and in the
latter instance they are indispensable.

* 8. When to Use Macros
How do we know whether a given function should really be a function,
rather than a macro? Most of the time there is a clear distinction
between the cases which call for macros and those which don't. By
default we should use functions: it is inelegant to use a macro where a
function would do. We should use macros only where they bring us some
specific advantage.

When do macros bring advantages? That is the subject of this chapter.
Usually the question is not one of advantage, but necessity. Most of the
things we do with macros, we could not do with functions. Section 8.1
lists the kinds of operators which can only be implemented as macros.
However, there is also a small (but interesting) class of borderline
cases, in which an operator might justifiably be written as a function
or a macro. For these situations, Section 8.2 gives the arguments for
and against macros. Finally, having considered what macros are capable
of doing, we turn in Section 8.3 to a related question: what kinds of
things do people do with them?

** 8.1 When Nothing Else Will Do
It's a general principle of good design that if you find similar code
appearing at several points in a program, you should write a subroutine
and replace the similar sequences of code with calls to the subroutine.
When we apply this principle to Lisp programs, we have to decide whether
the "subroutine" should be a function or a macro.

In some cases it's easy to decide to write a macro instead of a
function, because only a macro can do what's needed. A function like 1+
could conceivably be written as either a function or a macro:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun 1+ (x) (+ 1 x))

    (defmacro 1+ (x) `(+ 1 ,x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

But while, from Section 7.3, could only be defined as a macro:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro while (test &body body)
      `(do ()
           ((not ,test))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

There is no way to duplicate the behavior of this macro with a function.
The definition of while splices the expressions passed as body into the
body of a do, where they will be evaluated only if the test expression
returns nil. No function could do that; in a function call, all the
arguments are evaluated before the function is even invoked.

When you do need a macro, what do you need from it? Macros can do two
things that functions can't: they can control (or prevent) the
evaluation of their arguments, and they are expanded right into the
calling context. Any application which requires macros requires, in the
end, one or both of these properties.

The informal explanation that "macros don't evaluate their arguments" is
slightly wrong. It would be more precise to say that macros control the
evaluation of the arguments in the macro call. Depending on where the
argument is placed in the macro's expansion, it could be evaluated once,
many times, or not at all. Macros use this control in four major ways:

1. Transformation. The Common Lisp setf macro is one of a class of
   macros which pick apart their arguments before evaluation. A built-in
   access function will often have a converse whose purpose is to set
   what the access function retrieves. The converse of car is rplaca, of
   cdr, rplacd, and so on. With setf we can use calls to such access
   functions as if they were variables to be set, as in (setf (car x)
   'a), which could expand into

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       (progn (rplaca x 'a) 'a).
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   To perform this trick, setf has to look inside its first argument. To
   know that the case above requires rplaca, setf must be able to see
   that the first argument is an expression beginning with car. Thus
   setf, and any other operator which transforms its arguments, must be
   written as a macro.

2. Binding. Lexical variables must appear directly in the source code.
   The first argument to setq is not evaluated, for example, so anything
   built on setq must be a macro which expands into a setq, rather than
   a function which calls it. Likewise for operators like let, whose
   arguments are to appear as parameters in a lambda expression, for
   macros like do which expand into lets, and so on. Any new operator
   which is to alter the lexical bindings of its arguments must be
   written as a macro.
3. Conditional evaluation. All the arguments to a function are
   evaluated. In constructs like when, we want some arguments to be
   evaluated only under certain conditions. Such flexibility is only
   possible with macros.
4. Multiple evaluation. Not only are the arguments to a function all
   evaluated, they are all evaluated exactly once. We need a macro to
   define a construct like do, where certain arguments are to be
   evaluated repeatedly.

There are also several ways to take advantage of the inline expansion of
macros. It's important to emphasize that the expansions thus appear in
the lexical context of the macro call, since two of the three uses for
macros depend on that fact. They are:

1. Using the calling environment. A macro can generate an expansion
   containing a variable whose binding comes from the context of the
   macro call. The behavior of the following macro:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       (defmacro foo (x)
         `(+ ,x y))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   depends on the binding of y where foo is called. This kind of lexical
   intercourse is usually viewed more as a source of contagion than a
   source of pleasure. Usually it would be bad style to write such a
   macro. The ideal of functional programming applies as well to macros:
   the preferred way to communicate with a macro is through its
   parameters. Indeed, it is so rarely necessary to use the calling
   environment that most of the time it happens, it happens by mistake.
   (See Chapter 9.) Of all the macros in this book, only the
   continuation-passing macros (Chapter 20) and some parts of the ATN
   compiler (Chapter 23) use the calling environment in this way.

2. Wrapping a new environment. A macro can also cause its arguments to
   be evaluated in a new lexical environment. The classic example is
   let, which could be implemented as a macro on lambda (page 144).
   Within the body of an expression like (let ((y 2)) (+ x y)), y will
   refer to a new variable.
3. Saving function calls. The third consequence of the inline insertion
   of macroexpansions is that in compiled code there is no overhead
   associated with a macro call. By runtime, the macro call has been
   replaced by its expansion. (The same is true in principle of
   functions declared inline.)

Significantly, cases 5 and 6, when unintentional, constitute the problem
of variable capture, which is probably the worst thing a macro writer
has to fear. Variable capture is discussed in Chapter 9.

Instead of seven ways of using macros, it might be better to say that
there are six and a half. In an ideal world, all Common Lisp compilers
would obey inline declarations, and saving function calls would be a
task for inline functions, not macros. An ideal world is left as an
exercise to the reader.

<<Macro or Function?>><<SEC63>>

** 8.2 Macro or Function?
The previous section dealt with the easy cases. Any operator that needs
access to its parameters before they are evaluated should be written as
a macro, because there is no other choice. What about those operators
which could be written either way? Consider for example the operator
avg, which returns the average of its arguments. It could be defined as
a function

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun avg (&rest args)
      (/ (apply #'+ args) (length args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

but there is a good case for defining it as a macro,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro avg (&rest args)
      `(/ (+ ,@args) ,(length args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

because the function version would entail an unnecessary call to length
each time avg was called. At compile-time we may not know the values of
the arguments, but we do know how many there are, so the call to length
could just as well be made then. Here are several points to consider
when we face such choices:

<<The Pros>><<SEC64>>

    :END:

1. Computation at compile-time. A macro call involves computation at two
   times: when the macro is expanded, and when the expansion is
   evaluated. All the macroexpansion in a Lisp program is done when the
   program is compiled, and every bit of computation which can be done
   at compile-time is one bit that won't slow the program down when it's
   running. If an operator could be written to do some of its work in
   the macroexpansion stage, it will be more efficient to make it a
   macro, because whatever work a smart compiler can't do itself, a
   function has to do at runtime. Chapter 13 describes macros like avg
   which do some of their work during the expansion phase.
2. Integration with Lisp. Sometimes, using macros instead of functions
   will make a program more closely integrated with Lisp. Instead of
   writing a program to solve a certain problem, you may be able to use
   macros to transform the problem into one that Lisp already knows how
   to solve. This approach, when possible, will usually make programs
   both smaller and more efficient: smaller because Lisp is doing some
   of your work for you, and more efficient because production Lisp
   systems generally have had more of the fat sweated out of them than
   user programs. This advantage appears mostly in embedded languages,
   which are described starting in Chapter 19.
3. Saving function calls. A macro call is expanded right into the code
   where it appears. So if you write some frequently used piece of code
   as a macro, you can save a function call every time it's used. In
   earlier dialects of Lisp, programmers took advantage of this property
   of macros to save function calls at runtime. In Common Lisp, this job
   is supposed to be taken over by functions declared inline.

By declaring a function to be inline, you ask for it to be compiled
right into the calling code, just like a macro. However, there is a gap
between theory and practice here; CLTL2 (p. 229) says that "a compiler
is free to ignore this declaration," and some Common Lisp compilers do.
It may still be reasonable to use macros to save function calls, if you
are compelled to use such a compiler.

In some cases, the combined advantages of efficiency and close
integration with Lisp can create a strong argument for the use of
macros. In the query compiler of Chapter 19, the amount of computation
which can be shifted forward to compile-time is so great that it
justifies turning the whole program into a single giant macro. Though
done for speed, this shift also brings the program closer to Lisp: in
the new version, it's easier to use Lisp expressions--arithmetic
expressions, for example--within queries.

1. Functions are data, while macros are more like instructions to the
   compiler. Functions can be passed as arguments (e.g. to
   apply),returned by functions, or stored in data structures. None of
   these things are possible with macros. In some cases, you can get
   what you want by enclosing the macro call within a lambda-expression.
   This works, for example, if you want to apply or funcall certain
   macros:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       > (funcall #'(lambda (x y) (avg x y)) 1 3)
       2
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   However, this is an inconvenience. It doesn't always work, either:
   even if, like avg, the macro has an &rest parameter, there is no way
   to pass it a varying number of arguments.

2. Clarity of source code. Macro definitions can be harder to read than
   the equivalent function definitions. So if writing something as a
   macro would only make a program marginally better, it might be better
   to use a function instead.
3. Clarity at runtime. Macros are sometimes harder to debug than
   functions. If you get a runtime error in code which contains a lot of
   macro calls, the code you see in the backtrace could consist of the
   expansions of all those macro calls, and may bear little resemblance
   to the code you originally wrote. And because macros disappear when
   expanded, they are not accountable at runtime. You can't usually use
   trace to see how a macro is being called. If it worked at all, trace
   would show you the call to the macro's expander function, not the
   macro call itself.
4. Recursion. Using recursion in macros is not so simple as it is in
   functions. Although the expansion function of a macromay be
   recursive, the expansion itself may not be. Section 10.4 deals with
   the subject of recursion in macros.

All these considerations have to be balanced against one another in
deciding when to use macros. Only experience can tell which will
predominate. However, the examples of macros which appear in later
chapters cover most of the situations in which macros are useful. If a
potential macro is analogous to one given here, then it is probably safe
to write it as such.

Finally, it should be noted that clarity at runtime (point 6) rarely
becomes an issue. Debugging code which uses a lot of macros will not be
as difficult as you might expect. If macro definitions were several
hundred lines long, it might be unpleasant to debug their expansions at
runtime. But utilities, at least, tend to be written in small, trusted
layers. Generally their definitions are less than 15 lines long. So even
if you are reduced to poring over backtraces, such macros will not cloud
your view very much.

<<Applications for Macros>><<SEC66>>

** 8.3 Applications for Macros
Having considered what can be done with macros, the next question to ask
is: in what sorts of applications can we use them? The closest thing to
a general description of macro use would be to say that they are used
mainly for syntactic transformations. This is not to suggest that the
scope for macros is restricted. Since Lisp programs are made
from [fn:20] lists, which are Lisp data structures,
"syntactic transformation" can go a long way indeed. Chapters 19--24
present whole programs whose purpose could be described as syntactic
transformation, and which are, in effect, all macro.

Macro applications form a continuum between small general-purpose macros
like while, and the large, special-purpose macros defined in the later
chapters. On one end are the utilities, the macros resembling those that
every Lisp has built-in. They are usually small, general, and written in
isolation. However, you can write utilities for specific classes of
programs too, and when you have a collection of macros for use in, say,
graphics programs, they begin to look like a programming language for
graphics. At the far end of the continuum, macros allow you to write
whole programs in a language distinctly different from Lisp. Macros used
in this way are said to implement embedded languages.

Utilities are the first offspring of the bottom-up style. Even when a
program is too small to be built in layers, it may still benefit from
additions to the lowest layer, Lisp itself. The utility nil!, which sets
its argument to nil, could not be defined except as a macro:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro nil! (x)
      `(setf ,x nil))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Looking at nil!, one is tempted to say that it doesn't do anything, that
it merely saves typing. True, but all any macro does is save typing. If
one wants to think of it in these terms, the job of a compiler is to
save typing in machine language. The value of utilities should not be
underestimated, because their effect is cumulative: several layers of
simple macros can make the difference between an elegant program and an
incomprehensible one.

Most utilities are patterns embodied. When you notice a pattern in your
code, consider turning it into a utility. Patterns are just the sort of
thing computers are good at. Why should you bother following them when
you could have a program do it for you? Suppose that in writing some
program you find yourself using in many different places do loops of the
same general form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (do ()
        ((not #condition#))
      . #body of code#)
#+END_EXAMPLE

When you find a pattern repeated through your code, that pattern often
has a name. The name of this pattern is while. If we want to provide it
in a new utility, we will have to use a macro, because we need
conditional and repeated evaluation. If we define while using this
definition from page 91:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro while (test &body body)
      `(do ()
           ((not ,test))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then we can replace the instances of the pattern with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (while #condition#
      . #body of code#)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Doing so will make the code shorter and also make it declare in a
clearer voice what it's doing.

The ability to transform their arguments makes macros useful in writing
interfaces. The appropriate macro will make it possible to type a
shorter, simpler expression where a long or complex one would have been
required. Although graphic interfaces decrease the need to write such
macros for end users, programmers use this type of macro as much as
ever. The most common example is defun, which makes the binding of
functions resemble, on the surface, a function definition in a language
like Pascal or C. Chapter 2 mentioned that the following two expressions
have approximately the same effect:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun foo (x) (* x 2))

    (setf (symbol-function 'foo)
          #'(lambda (x) (* x 2)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Thus defun can be implemented as a macro which turns the former into the
latter. We could imagine it written as follows:[fn:21]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro our-defun (name parms &body body)
      `(progn
         (setf (symbol-function ',name)
           #'(lambda ,parms (block ,name ,@body)))
         ',name))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Macros like while and nil! could be described as general-purpose
utilities. Any Lisp program might use them. But particular domains can
have their utilities as well. There is no reason to suppose that base
Lisp is the only level at which you have a programming language to
extend. If you're writing a CAD program, for example, the best results
will sometimes come from writing it in two layers: a language (or if you
prefer a more modest term, a toolkit) for CAD programs, and in the layer
above, your particular application.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun move-objs (objs dx dy)
      (multiple-value-bind (x0 y0 x1 y1) (bounds objs)
        (dolist (o objs)
          (incf (obj-x o) dx)
          (incf (obj-y o) dy))
        (multiple-value-bind (xa ya xb yb) (bounds objs)
          (redraw (min x0 xa) (min y0 ya)
              (max x1 xb) (max y1 yb)))))

    (defun scale-objs (objs factor)
      (multiple-value-bind (x0 y0 x1 y1) (bounds objs)
        (dolist (o objs)
          (setf (obj-dx o) (* (obj-dx o) factor)
            (obj-dy o) (* (obj-dy o) factor)))
        (multiple-value-bind (xa ya xb yb) (bounds objs)
          (redraw (min x0 xa) (min y0 ya)
              (max x1 xb) (max y1 yb)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<IDX37>>

Lisp blurs many distinctions which other languages take for granted. In
other languages, there really are conceptual distinctions between
compile-time and runtime, program and data, language and program. In
Lisp, these distinctions exist only as conversational conventions. There
is no line dividing, for example, language and program. You can draw the
line wherever suits the problem at hand. So it really is no more than a
question of terminology whether to call an underlying layer of code a
toolkit or a language. One advantage of considering it as a language is
that it suggests you can extend this language, as you do Lisp, with
utilities.

Suppose we are writing an interactive 2D drawing program. For
simplicity, we will assume that the only objects handled by the program
are line segments, represented as an origin #x,y# and a vector #dx,dy#.
One of the things such a program will have to do is slide groups of
objects. This is the purpose of the function move-objs in Figure 8.1.
For efficiency, we don't want to redraw the whole screen after each
operation--only the parts which have changed. Hence the two calls to the
function bounds, which returns four coordinates (min x, min y, max x,
max y) representing the bounding rectangle of a group of objects. The
operative part of move-objs is sandwiched between two calls to bounds
which find the bounding rectangle before and then after the movement,
and then redraw the entire affected region.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-redraw ((var objs) &body body)
      (let ((gob (gensym))
        (x0 (gensym)) (y0 (gensym))
        (x1 (gensym)) (y1 (gensym)))
        `(let ((,gob ,objs))
           (multiple-value-bind (,x0 ,y0 ,x1 ,y1) (bounds ,gob)
         (dolist (,var ,gob) ,@body)
         (multiple-value-bind (xa ya xb yb) (bounds ,gob)
           (redraw (min ,x0 xa) (min ,y0 ya)
               (max ,x1 xb) (max ,y1 yb)))))))

    (defun move-objs (objs dx dy)
      (with-redraw (o objs)
               (incf (obj-x o) dx)
               (incf (obj-y o) dy)))

    (defun scale-objs (objs factor)
      (with-redraw (o objs)
               (setf (obj-dx o) (* (obj-dx o) factor)
                 (obj-dy o) (* (obj-dy o) factor))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 8.2: Move and scale filleted.

<<IDX38>>

The function scale-objs is for changing the size of a group of objects.
Since the bounding region could grow or shrink depending on the scale
factor, this function too must do its work between two calls to bounds.
As we wrote more of the program, we would see more of this pattern: in
functions to rotate, flip, transpose, and so on.

With a macro we can abstract out the code that these functions would all
have in common. The macro with-redraw in Figure 8.2 provides the
skeleton that the functions in Figure 8.1 share.[fn:22] As
a result, they can now be defined in four lines each, as at the end of
Figure 8.2. With these two functions the new macro has already paid for
itself in brevity. And how much clearer the two functions become once
the details of screen redrawing are abstracted away.

One way to view with-redraw is as a construct in a language for writing
interactive drawing programs. As we develop more such macros, they will
come to resemble a programming language in fact as well as in name, and
our application itself will begin to show the elegance one would expect
in a program written in a language defined for its specific needs.

The other major use of macros is to implement embedded languages. Lisp
is an exceptionally good language in which to write programming
languages, because Lisp programs can be expressed as lists, and Lisp has
a built-in parser (read) and compiler (compile) for programs so
expressed. Most of the time you don't even have to call compile; you can
have your embedded language compiled implicitly, by compiling the code
which does the transformations (page 25).

An embedded language is one which is not written on top of Lisp so much
as commingled with it, so that the syntax is a mixture of Lisp and
constructs specific to the new language. The naive way to implement an
embedded language is to write an interpreter for it in Lisp. A better
approach, when possible, is to implement the language by transformation:
transform each expression into the Lisp code that the interpreter would
have run in order to evaluate it. That's where macros come in. The job
of macros is precisely to transform one type of expression into another,
so they're the natural choice when writing embedded languages.

In general, the more an embedded language can be implemented by
transformation, the better. For one, it's less work. If the new language
has arithmetic, for example, you needn't face all the complexities of
representing and manipulating numeric quantities. If Lisp's arithmetic
capabilities are sufficient for your purposes, then you can simply
transform your arithmetic expressions into the equivalent Lisp ones, and
leave the rest to the Lisp.

Using transformation will ordinarily make your embedded languages faster
as well. Interpreters have inherent disadvantages with respect to speed.
When code occurs within a loop, for example, an interpreter will often
have to do work on each iteration which in compiled code could have been
done just once. An embedded language which has its own interpreter will
therefore be slow,even if the interpreter itself is compiled. But if the
expressions in the new language are transformed into Lisp, the resulting
code can then be compiled by the Lisp compiler. A language so
implemented need suffer none of the overheads of interpretation at
runtime. Short of writing a true compiler for your language, macros will
yield the best performance. In fact, the macros which transform the new
language can be seen as a compiler for it--just one which relies on the
existing Lisp compiler to do most of the work.

We won't consider any examples of embedded languages here, since
Chapters 19--25 are all devoted to the topic. Chapter 19 deals
specifically with the difference between interpreting and transforming
embedded languages, and shows the same language implemented by each of
the two methods.

One book on Common Lisp asserts that the scope for macros is limited,
citing as evidence the fact that, of the operators defined in CLTL1,
less than 10% were macros. This is like saying that since our house is
made of bricks, our furniture will be too. The proportion of macros in a
Common Lisp program will depend entirely on what it's supposed to do.
Some programs will contain no macros. Some programs could be all macros.

* 9. Variable Capture
Macros are vulnerable to a problem called variable capture. Variable
capture occurs when macroexpansion causes a name clash: when some symbol
ends up referring to a variable from another context. Inadvertent
variable capture can cause extremely subtle bugs. This chapter is about
how to foresee and avoid them. However, intentional variable capture is
a useful programming technique, and Chapter 14 is full of macros which
rely on it.

** 9.1 Macro Argument Capture
A macro vulnerable to unintended variable capture is a macro with a bug.
To avoid writing such macros, we must know precisely when capture can
occur. Instances of variable capture can be traced to one of two
situations: macro argument capture and free symbol capture. In argument
capture, a symbol passed as an argument in the macro call inadvertently
refers to a variable established by the macro expansion itself. Consider
the following definition of the macro for, which iterates over a body of
expressions like a Pascal for loop:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body) ; wrong
      `(do ((,var ,start (1+ ,var))
        (limit ,stop))
           ((> ,var limit))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This macro looks correct at first sight. It even seems to work fine:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (for (x 1 5)
    (princ x))
    12345
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Indeed, the error is so subtle that we might use this version of the
macro hundreds of times and have it always work perfectly. Not if we
call it this way, though:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (for (limit 1 5)
         (princ limit))
#+END_EXAMPLE

We might expect this expression to have the same effect as the one
before. But it doesn't print anything; it generates an error. To see
why, we look at its expansion:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (do ((limit 1 (1+ limit))
         (limit 5))
        ((> limit limit))
      (princ limit))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now it's obvious what goes wrong. There is a name clash between a symbol
local to the macro expansion and a symbol passed as an argument to the
macro. The macroexpansion captures limit. It ends up occurring twice in
the same do, which is illegal.

Errors caused by variable capture are rare, but what they lack in
frequency they make up in viciousness. This capture was comparatively
mild--here, at least, we got an error. More often than not, a capturing
macro would simply yield incorrect results with no indication that
anything was wrong. In this case,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((limit 5))
    (for (i 1 10)
    (when (> i limit)
    (princ i))))
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

the resulting code quietly does nothing.

<<Free Symbol Capture>><<SEC69>>

** 9.2 Free Symbol Capture
Less frequently, the macro definition itself contains a symbol which
inadvertently refers to a binding in the environment where the macro is
expanded. Suppose some program, instead of printing warnings to the user
as they arise, wants to store the warnings in a list, to be examined
later. One person writes a macro gripe, which takes a warning message
and adds it to a global list, w:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defvar w nil)

    (defmacro gripe (warning)       ; wrong
      `(progn (setq w (nconc w (list ,warning)))
          nil))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Someone else then wants to write a function sample-ratio, to return the
ratio of the lengths of two lists. If either of the lists has less than
two elements, the function is to return nil instead, also issuing a
warning that it was called on a statistically insignificant case.
(Actual warnings could be more informative, but their content isn't
relevant to this example.)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun sample-ratio (v w)
      (let ((vn (length v)) (wn (length w)))
        (if (or (< vn 2) (< wn 2))
        (gripe "sample < 2")
          (/ vn wn))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If sample-ratio is called with w = (b), then it will want to warn that
one of its arguments, with only one element, is statistically
insignificant. But when the call to gripe is expanded, it will be as if
sample-ratio had been defined:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun sample-ratio (v w)
      (let ((vn (length v)) (wn (length w)))
        (if (or (< vn 2) (< wn 2))
        (progn (setq w (nconc w (list "sample < 2")))
               nil)
          (/ vn wn))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The problem here is that gripe is used in a context where w has its own
local binding. The warning, instead of being saved in the global warning
list, will be nconced onto the end of one of the parameters of
sample-ratio. Not only is the warning lost, but the list (b), which is
probably used as data elsewhere in the program, will have an extraneous
string appended to it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((lst '(b)))
    (sample-ratio nil lst)
    lst)
    (B "sample < 2")
    > w
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<When Capture Occurs>><<SEC70>>

** 9.3 When Capture Occurs
It's asking a lot of the macro writer to be able to look at a macro
definition and foresee all the possible problems arising from these two
types of capture. Variable capture is a subtle matter, and it takes some
experience to anticipate all the ways a capturable symbol could wreak
mischief in a program. Fortunately, you can detect and eliminate
capturable symbols in your macro definitions without having to think
about how their capture could send your program awry. This section
provides a straightforward rule for detecting capturable symbols. The
remaining sections of this chapter explain techniques for eliminating
them.

The rule for defining a capturable variable depends on some subordinate
concepts, which must be defined first:

Free: A symbol s occurs free in an expression when it is used as a
variable in that expression, but the expression does not create a
binding for it. In the following expression,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x y) (z 10))
      (list w x z))
#+END_EXAMPLE

w, x and z all occur free within the list expression, which establishes
no bindings. However, the enclosing let expression establishes bindings
for x and z, so within the let as a whole, only y and w occur free. Note
that in

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x x))
      x)
#+END_EXAMPLE

the second instance of x is free--it's not within the scope of the new
binding being established for x. Skeleton: The skeleton of a macro
expansion is the whole expansion, minus anything which was part of an
argument in the macro call. If foo is defined:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro foo (x y)
      `(/ (+ ,x 1) ,y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and called thus:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (foo (- 5 2) 6)
#+END_EXAMPLE

then it yields the macro expansion:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (/ (+ (- 5 2) 1) 6)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The skeleton of this expansion is the above expression with holes where
the parameters x and y got inserted:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (/ (+ 1) )
#+END_EXAMPLE

With these two concepts defined, it's possible to state a concise rule
for detecting capturable symbols:

Capturable: A symbol is capturable in some macro expansion if (a) it
occurs free in the skeleton of the macro expansion, or (b) it is bound
by a part of the skeleton in which arguments passed to the macro are
either bound or evaluated. Some examples will show the implications of
this rule. In the simplest case:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro cap1 ()
      '(+ x 1))
#+END_EXAMPLE

x is capturable because it will occur free in the skeleton. That's what
caused the bug in gripe. In this macro:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro cap2 (var)
      `(let ((x ...)
         (,var ...))
         ...))
#+END_EXAMPLE

x is capturable because it is bound in an expression where an argument
to the macro call will also be bound. (That's what went wrong in for.)
Likewise for the following two macros

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro cap3 (var)
      `(let ((x ...))
         (let ((,var ...))
           ...)))

    (defmacro cap4 (var)
      `(let ((,var ...))
         (let ((x ...))
           ...)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

in both of which x is capturable. However, if there is no context in
which the binding of x and the variable passed as an argument will both
be visible, as in

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro safe1 (var)
      `(progn (let ((x 1))
            (print x))
          (let ((,var 1))
            (print ,var))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then x won't be capturable. Not all variables bound by the skeleton are
at risk. However, if arguments to the macro call are evaluated within a
binding established by the skeleton,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro cap5 (&body body)
      `(let ((x ...))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then variables so bound are at risk of capture: in cap5, x is
capturable. In this case, though,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro safe2 (expr)
      `(let ((x ,expr))
         (cons x 1)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

x is not capturable, because when the argument passed to expr is
evaluated, the new binding of x won't be visible. Note also that it's
only the binding of skeletal variables we have to worry about. In this
macro

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro safe3 (var &body body)
      `(let ((,var ...))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

no symbol is at risk of inadvertent capture (assuming that the user
expects that the first argument will be bound).

Now let's look at the original definition of for in light of the new
rule for identifying capturable symbols:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body) ; wrong
      `(do ((,var ,start (1+ ,var))
        (limit ,stop))
           ((> ,var limit))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

It turns out now that this definition of for is vulnerable to capture in
two ways: limit could be passed as the first argument to for, as in the
original example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (for (limit 1 5)
         (princ limit))
#+END_EXAMPLE

but it's just as dangerous if limit occurs in the body of the loop:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((limit 0))
      (for (x 1 10)
           (incf limit x))
      limit)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Someone using for in this way would be expecting his own binding of
limit to be the one incremented in the loop, and the expression as a
whole to return 55; in fact, only the binding of limit generated by the
skeleton of the expansion will be incremented:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (do ((x 1 (1+ x))
         (limit 10))
        ((> x limit))
      (incf limit x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and since that's the one which controls iteration, the loop won't even
terminate.

The rules presented in this section should be used with the reservation
that they are intended only as a guide. They are not even formally
stated, let alone formally correct. The problem of capture is a vaguely
defined one, since it depends on expectations. For example, in an
expression like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x 1)) (list x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

we don't regard it as an error that when (list x) is evaluated, x will
refer to a new variable. That's what let is supposed to do. The rules
for detecting capture are also imprecise. You could write macros which
passed these tests, and which still would be vulnerable to unintended
capture. For example,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro pathological (&body body)    ; wrong
      (let* ((syms (remove-if (complement #'symbolp)
                  (flatten body)))
         (var (nth (random (length syms))
               syms)))
        `(let ((,var 99))
           ,@body)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

When this macro is called, the expressions in the body will be evaluated
as if in a progn--but one random variable within the body may have a
different value. This is clearly capture, but it passes our tests,
because the variable does not occur in the skeleton. In practice,
though, the rules will work nearly all the time: one rarely (if ever)
wants to write a macro like the example above.

Vulnerable to capture:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro before (x y seq)
      `(let ((seq ,seq))
         (< (position ,x seq)
        (position ,y seq))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

A correct version:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro before (x y seq)
      `(let ((xval ,x) (yval ,y) (seq ,seq))
         (< (position xval seq)
        (position yval seq))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 9.1: Avoiding capture with let.

<<IDX39>>

<<Avoiding Capture with Better Names>><<SEC71>>

** 9.4 Avoiding Capture with Better Names
The first two sections divided instances of variable capture into two
types: argument capture, where a symbol used in an argument is caught by
a binding established by the macro skeleton, and free symbol capture,
where a free symbol in a macroexpansion is caught by a binding in force
where the macro is expanded. The latter cases are usually dealt with
simply by giving global variables distinguished names. In Common Lisp,
it is traditional to give global variables names which begin and end
with asterisks. The variable defining the current package is called
*package*, for example. (Such a name may be pronounced
"star-package-star" to emphasize that it is not an ordinary variable.)

So really it was the responsibility of the author of gripe to store
warnings in a variable called something like *warnings*, rather than
just w. If the author of sample-ratio had used *warnings* as a
parameter, then he would deserve every bug he got, but he can't be
blamed for thinking that it would be safe to call a parameter w.

<<Avoiding Capture by Prior Evaluation>><<SEC72>>

** 9.5 Avoiding Capture by Prior Evaluation
Sometimes argument capture can be cured simply by evaluating the
endangered arguments outside of any bindings created by the
macroexpansion. The simplest cases can be handled by beginning the macro
with a let expression. Figure 9.1 contains two versions of the macro
before, which takes two objects and a sequence, and returns true iff the
first object occurs before the second in the
sequence.[fn:23] The first definition is incorrect. Its
initial let ensures that the form passed as seq is only evaluated once,
but it is not sufficient to avoid the following problem:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (before (progn (setq seq '(b a)) 'a)
    'b
    '(a b))
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

This amounts to asking "Is a before b in (a b)?" If before were correct,
it would return true. Macroexpansion shows what really happens: the
evaluation of the first argument to < rearranges the list to be searched
in the second.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((seq '(a b)))
      (< (position (progn (setq seq '(b a)) 'a)
               seq)
         (position 'b seq)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

To avoid this problem, it will suffice to evaluate all the arguments
first in one big let. The second definition in Figure 9.1 is thus safe
from capture.

Unfortunately, the let technique works only in a narrow range of cases:
macros where

1. all the arguments at risk of capture are evaluated exactly once, and
2. none of the arguments need to be evaluated in the scope of bindings
   established by the macro skeleton.

This rules out a great many macros. The proposed for macro violates both
conditions. However, we can use a variation of this scheme to make
macros like for safe from capture: to wrap its body forms within a
lambda-expression outside of any locally created bindings.

Some macros, including those for iteration, yield expansions where
expressions appearing in the macro call will be evaluated within newly
established bindings. In the definition of for, for example, the body of
the loop must be evaluated within a do created by the macro. Variables
occurring in the body of the loop are thus vulnerable to capture by
bindings established by the do. We can protect variables in the body
from such capture by wrapping the body in a closure, and, within the
loop, instead of inserting the expressions themselves, simply funcalling
the closure.

Vulnerable to capture:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body)
      `(do ((,var ,start (1+ ,var))
        (limit ,stop))
           ((> ,var limit))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

A correct version:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body)
      `(do ((b #'(lambda (,var) ,@body))
        (count ,start (1+ count))
        (limit ,stop))
           ((> count limit))
         (funcall b count)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 9.2: Avoiding capture with a closure.

<<IDX40>>

Figure 9.2 shows a version of for which uses this technique. Since the
closure is the first thing made by the expansion of a for, free symbols
occurring in the body will all refer to variables in the environment of
the macro call. Now the do communicates with its body through the
parameters of the closure. All the closure needs to know from the do is
the number of the current iteration, so it has only one parameter, the
symbol specified as the index variable in the macro call.

The technique of wrapping expressions in lambdas is not a universal
remedy. You can use it to protect a body of code, but closures won't be
any use when, for example, there is a risk of the same variable being
bound twice by the same let or do (as in our original broken for).
Fortunately, in this case, by rewriting for to package its body in a
closure, we also eliminated the need for the do to establish bindings
for the var argument. The var argument of the old for became the
parameter of the closure and could be replaced in the do by an actual
symbol, count. So the new definition of for is completely immune from
capture, as the test in Section 9.3 will show.

The disadvantage of using closures is that they might be less efficient.
We could be introducing another function call. Potentially worse, if the
compiler doesn't give the closure dynamic extent, space for it will have
to be allocated in the heap at runtime.

<<Avoiding Capture with Gensyms>><<SEC73>>

** 9.6 Avoiding Capture with Gensyms
There is one certain way to avoid macro argument capture: replacing
capturable symbols with gensyms. In the original version of for,
problems arise when two symbols inadvertently have the same name. If we
want to avoid the possibility that a macro skeleton will contain a
symbol also used by the calling code, we might hope to get away with
using only strangely named symbols in macro definitions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body) ; wrong
      `(do ((,var ,start (1+ ,var))
        (xsf2jsh ,stop))
           ((> ,var xsf2jsh))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

but this is no solution. It doesn't eliminate the bug, just makes it
less likely to show. And not so very less likely at that--it's still
possible to imagine conflicts arising in nested instances of the same
macro.

We need some way to ensure that a symbol is unique. The Common Lisp
function gensym exists just for this purpose. It returns a symbol,
called a gensym, which is guaranteed not to be eq to any symbol either
typed in or constructed by a program.

How can Lisp promise this? In Common Lisp, each package keeps a list of
all the symbols known in that package. (For an introduction to packages,
see page 381.) A symbol which is on the list is said to be interned in
the package. Each call to gensym returns a unique, uninterned symbol.
And since every symbol seen by read gets interned, no one could type
anything identical to a gensym. Thus, if you begin the expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (eq (gensym) ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

there is no way to complete it that will cause it to return true.

Asking gensym to make you a symbol is like taking the approach of
choosing a strangely named symbol one step further--gensym will give you
a symbol whose name isn't even in the phone book. When Lisp has to
display a gensym,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (gensym)
    #:G47
#+END_EXAMPLE

what it prints is really just Lisp's equivalent of "John Doe," an
arbitrary name made up for something whose name is irrelevant. And to be
sure that we don't have any illusions about this, gensyms are displayed
preceded by a sharp-colon, a special read-macro which exists just to
cause an error if we ever try to read the gensym in again.

Vulnerable to capture:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body)
      `(do ((,var ,start (1+ ,var))
        (limit ,stop))
           ((> ,var limit))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

A correct version:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body)
      (let ((gstop (gensym)))
        `(do ((,var ,start (1+ ,var))
          (,gstop ,stop))
         ((> ,var ,gstop))
           ,@body)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 9.3: Avoiding capture with gensym.

In CLTL2 Common Lisp, the number in a gensym's printed representation
comes from *gensym-counter*, a global variable always bound to an
integer. By resetting this counter we can cause two gensyms to print the
same

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq x (gensym))
    #:G48
    > (setq *gensym-counter* 48 y (gensym))
    #:G48
    > (eq x y)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

but they won't be identical.

Figure 9.3 contains a correct definition of for using gensyms. Now there
is no limit to clash with symbols in forms passed to the macro. It has
been replaced by a symbol gensymed on the spot. In each expansion of the
macro, the place of limit will be taken by a unique symbol created at
expansion-time.

The correct definition of for is a complicated one to produce on the
first try. Finished code, like a finished theorem, often covers up a lot
of trial and error. So don't worry if you have to write several versions
of a macro. To begin writing macros like for, you may want to write the
first version without thinking about variable capture, and then to go
back and make gensyms for symbols which could be involved in captures.

<<Avoiding Capture with Packages>><<SEC74>>

** 9.7 Avoiding Capture with Packages
To some extent, it is possible to avoid capture by defining macros in
their own package. If you create a macros package and define for there,
you can even use the definition given first

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body)
      `(do ((,var ,start (1+ ,var))
        (limit ,stop))
           ((> ,var limit))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and call it safely from any other package. If you call for from another
package, say mycode, then even if you do use limit as the first
argument, it will be mycode::limit--a distinct symbol from
macros::limit, which occurs in the macro skeleton.

However, packages do not provide a very general solution to the problem
of capture. In the first place, macros are an integral part of some
programs, and it would be inconvenient to have to separate them in their
own package. Second, this approach offers no protection against capture
by other code in the macros package.

<<Capture in Other Name-Spaces>><<SEC75>>

** 9.8 Capture in Other Name-Spaces
The previous sections have spoken of capture as if it were a problem
which afflicted variables exclusively. Although most capture is variable
capture, the problem can arise in Common Lisp's other name-spaces as
well.

Functions may also be locally bound, and function bindings are equally
liable to inadvertent capture. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (defun fn (x) (+ x 1))
    FN
    > (defmacro mac (x) `(fn ,x))
    MAC
    > (mac 10)
    11
    > (labels ((fn (y) (- y 1)))
    (mac 10))
    9
#+END_EXAMPLE

As predicted by the capture rule, the fn which occurs free in the
skeleton of mac is at risk of capture. When fn is locally rebound, mac
returns a different value than it does generally.

What to do about this case? When the symbol at risk of capture is the
name of a built-in function or macro, then it's reasonable to do
nothing. In CLTL2 (p. 260) if the name of anything built-in is given a
local function or macro binding, "the consequences are undefined." So it
wouldn't matter what your macro did--anyone who rebinds built-in
functions is going to have problems with more than just your macros.

Otherwise, you can protect function names against macro argument capture
the same way you would protect variable names: by using gensyms as names
for any functions given local definitions by the macro skeleton.
Avoiding free symbol capture, as in the case above, is a bit more
difficult. The way to protect variables against free symbol capture was
to give them distinctly global names: e.g. *warnings* instead of w. This
solution is not practical for functions, because there is no convention
for distinguishing the names of global functions--most functions are
global. If you're concerned about a macro being called in an environment
where a function it needs might be locally redefined, the best solution
is probably to put your code in a distinct package.

Block-names are also liable to capture, as are the tags used by go and
throw. When your macros need such symbols,you should use gensyms,as in
the definition of our-do on page 98.

Remember also that operators like do are implicitly enclosed in a block
named nil. Thus a return or return-from nil within a do returns from the
do, not the containing expression:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (block nil
    (list 'a
    (do ((x 1 (1+ x)))
    (nil)
    (if (> x 5)
    (return-from nil x)
    (princ x)))))
    12345
    (A 6)
#+END_EXAMPLE

If do didn't create a block named nil, this example would have returned
just 6, rather than (A 6).

The implicit block in do is not a problem, because do is advertised to
behave this way. However, you should realize that if you write macros
which expand into dos, they will capture the block name nil. In a macro
like for, a return or return-from nil will return from the for
expression, not the enclosing block.

** 9.9 Why Bother?
Some of the preceding examples are pretty pathological. Looking at them,
one might be tempted to say "variable capture is so unlikely--why even
worry about it?" There are two ways to answer this question. One is with
another question: why write programs with small bugs when you could
write programs with no bugs?

The longer answer is to point out that in real applications it's
dangerous to assume anything about the way your code will be used. Any
Lisp program has what is now called an "open architecture." If you're
writing code other people will use, they may use it in ways you'd never
anticipate. And it's not just people you have to worry about. Programs
write programs too. It may be that no human would write code like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (before (progn (setq seq '(b a)) 'a)
        'b
        '(a b))
#+END_EXAMPLE

but code generated by programs often looks like this. Even if individual
macros generate simple and reasonable-looking expansions, once you begin
to nest macro calls, the expansions can become large programs which look
like nothing any human would write. Under such circumstances, it is
worth defending against cases, however contrived, which might make your
macros expand incorrectly.

In the end, avoiding variable capture is not very difficult anyway. It
soon becomes second-nature. The classic Common Lisp defmacro is like a
cook's knife: an elegant idea which seems dangerous, but which experts
use with confidence.

* 10. Other Macro Pitfalls
Writing macros requires an extra degree of caution. A function is
isolated in its own lexical world, but a macro, because it is expanded
into the calling code, can give the user an unpleasant surprise unless
it is carefully written. Chapter 9 explained variable capture, the
biggest such surprise. This chapter discusses four more problems to
avoid when defining macros.

** 10.1 Number of Evaluations
Several incorrect versions of for appeared in the previous chapter.
Figure 10.1 shows two more, accompanied by a correct version for
comparison.

Though not vulnerable to capture, the second for contains a bug. It will
generate an expansion in which the form passed as stop will be evaluated
on each iteration. In the best case, this kind of macro is inefficient,
repeatedly doing what it could have done just once. If stop has
side-effects, the macro could actually produce incorrect results. For
example, this loop will never terminate, because the goal recedes on
each iteration:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((x 2))
    (for (i 1 (incf x))
    (princ i)))
    12345678910111213...
#+END_EXAMPLE

In writing macros like for, one must remember that the arguments to a
macro are forms, not values. Depending on where they appear in the
expansion, they could be evaluated more than once. In this case, the
solution is to bind a variable to the value returned by the stop form,
and refer to the variable during the loop.

Unless they are clearly intended for iteration, macros should ensure
that expressions are evaluated exactly as many times as they appear in
the macro call.

A correct version:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body)
      (let ((gstop (gensym)))
        `(do ((,var ,start (1+ ,var))
          (,gstop ,stop))
         ((> ,var ,gstop))
           ,@body)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Subject to multiple evaluations:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body)
      `(do ((,var ,start (1+ ,var)))
           ((> ,var ,stop))
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Incorrect order of evaluation:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body)
    (let ((gstop (gensym)))
    `(do ((,gstop ,stop)
    (,var ,start (1+ ,var)))
    ((> ,var ,gstop))
    ,@body)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 10.1: Controlling argument evaluation.

<<IDX42>>

There are obvious cases in which this rule does not apply: the Common
Lisp or would be much less useful (it would become a Pascal or) if all
its arguments were always evaluated. But in such cases the user knows
how many evaluations to expect. This isn't so with the second version of
for: the user has no reason to suppose that the stop form is evaluated
more than once, and in fact there is no reason that it should be. A
macro written like the second version of for is most likely written that
way by mistake.

Unintended multiple evaluation is a particularly difficult problem for
macros built on setf. Common Lisp provides several utilities to make
writing such macros easier. The problem, and the solution, are discussed
in Chapter 12.

<<Order of Evaluation>><<SEC79>>

** 10.2 Order of Evaluation
The order in which expressions are evaluated, though not as important as
the number of times they are evaluated, can sometimes become an issue.
In Common Lisp function calls, arguments are evaluated left-to-right:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq x 10)
    10
    > (+ (setq x 3) x)
    6
#+END_EXAMPLE

and it is good practice for macros to do the same. Macros should usually
ensure that expressions are evaluated in the same order that they appear
in the macro call.

In Figure 10.1, the third version of for also contains a subtle bug. The
parameter stop will be evaluated before start, even though they appear
in the opposite order in the macro call:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((x 1))
    (for (i x (setq x 13))
    (princ i)))
    13
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

This macro gives a disconcerting impression of going back in time. The
evaluation of the stop form influences the value returned by the start
form, even though the start form appears first textually.

The correct version of for ensures that its arguments will be evaluated
in the order in which they appear:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((x 1))
    (for (i x (setq x 13))
    (princ i)))
    12345678910111213
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now setting x in the stop form has no effect on the value returned by
the previous argument.

Although the preceding example is a contrived one, there are cases in
which this sort of problem might really happen, and such a bug would be
extremely difficult to find. Perhaps few people would write code in
which the evaluation of one argument to a macro influenced the value
returned by another, but people may do by accident things that they
would never do on purpose. As well as having to work right when used as
intended, a utility must not mask bugs. If anyone wrote code like the
foregoing examples, it would probably be by mistake, but the correct
version of for will make the mistake easier to detect.

<<Non-functional Expanders>><<SEC80>>

** 10.3 Non-functional Expanders
Lisp expects code which generates macro expansions to be purely
functional, in the sense described in Chapter 3. Expander code should
depend on nothing but the forms passed to it as arguments, and should
not try to have an effect on the world except by returning values.

As of CLTL2 (p. 685), it is safe to assume that macro calls in compiled
code will not be re-expanded at runtime. Otherwise, Common Lisp makes no
guarantees about when, or how often, a macro call will be expanded. It
is considered an error for the expansion of a macro to vary depending on
either. For example, suppose we wanted to count the number of times some
macro is used. We can't simply do a search through the source files,
because the macro might be called in code which is generated by the
program. We might therefore want to define the macro as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro nil! (x)            ; wrong
      (incf *nil!s*)
      `(setf ,x nil))
#+END_EXAMPLE

With this definition, the global *nil!s* will be incremented each time a
call to nil! is expanded. However, we are mistaken if we expect the
value of this variable to tell us how often nil! was called. A given
call can be, and often is, expanded more than once. For example, a
preprocessor which performed transformations on your source code might
have to expand the macro calls in an expression before it could decide
whether or not to transform it.

As a general rule, expander code shouldn't depend on anything except its
arguments. So any macro which builds its expansion out of strings, for
example, should be careful not to assume anything about what the package
will be at the time of expansion. This concise but rather pathological
example,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro string-call (opstring &rest args) ; wrong
      `(,(intern opstring) ,@args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

defines a macro which takes the print name of an operator and expands
into a call to it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (defun our+ (x y) (+ x y))
    OUR+
    > (string-call "OUR+" 2 3)
    5
#+END_EXAMPLE

The call to intern takes a string and returns the corresponding symbol.
However, if we omit the optional package argument, it does so in the
current package. The expansion will thus depend on the package at the
time the expansion is generated, and unless our+ is visible in that
package, the expansion will be a call to an unknown function.

Miller and Benson's Lisp Style and Design mentions one particularly ugly
example of problems arising from side-effects in expander code. In
Common Lisp, as of CLTL2 (p. 78), the lists bound to &rest parameters
are not guaranteed to be freshly made. They may share structure with
lists elsewhere in the program. In consequence, you shouldn't
destructively modify &rest parameters, because you don't know what else
you'll be modifying.

This possibility affects both functions and macros. With functions,
problems would arise when using apply. In a valid implementation of
Common Lisp the following could happen. Suppose we define a function
et-al, which returns a list of its arguments with et al added to the
end:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun et-al (&rest args)
      (nconc args (list 'et 'al)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we called this function normally, it would seem to work fine:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (et-al 'smith 'jones)
    (SMITH JONES ET AL)
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, if we called it via apply, it could alter existing data
structures:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq greats '(leonardo michelangelo))
    (LEONARDO MICHELANGELO)
    > (apply #'et-al greats)
    (LEONARDO MICHELANGELO ET AL)
    > greats
    (LEONARDO MICHELANGELO ET AL)
#+END_EXAMPLE

At least, a valid implementation of Common Lisp could do this, though so
far none seems to.

For macros, the danger is greater. A macro which altered an &rest
parameter could thereby alter the macro call. That is, you could end up
with inadvertently self-rewriting programs. The danger is also more
real--it actually happens under existing implementations. If we define a
macro which nconcs something onto its &rest argument[fn:24]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro echo (&rest args)
      `',(nconc args (list 'amen)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and then define a function that calls it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun foo () (echo x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

in one widely used Common Lisp, the following will happen:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (foo)
    (X AMEN AMEN)
    > (foo)
    (X AMEN AMEN AMEN)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Not only does foo return the wrong result, it returns a different result
each time, because each macroexpansion alters the definition of foo.

This example also illustrates the point made earlier about multiple
expansions of a given macro call. In this particular implementation, the
first call to foo returns a lists with two amens. For some reason this
implementation expanded the macro call once when foo was defined, as
well as once in each of the succeeding calls.

It would be safer to have defined echo as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro echo (&rest args)
      `'(,@args amen))
#+END_EXAMPLE

because a comma-at is equivalent to an append rather than an nconc.
After redefining this macro, foo will have to be redefined as well, even
if it wasn't compiled, because the previous version of echo caused it to
be rewritten.

In macros, it's not only &rest parameters which are subject to this
danger. Any macro argument which is a list should be left alone. If we
define a macro which modifies one of its arguments, and a function which
calls it,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro crazy (expr) (nconc expr (list t)))

    (defun foo () (crazy (list)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then the source code of the calling function could get modified, as
happens in one implementation the first time we call it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (foo)
    (T T)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This happens in compiled as well as interpreted code.

The upshot is, don't try to avoid consing by destructively modifying
parameter list structure. The resulting programs won't be portable, if
they run at all. If you want to avoid consing in a function which takes
a variable number of arguments, one solution is to use a macro, and
thereby shift the consing forward to compile-time. For this application
of macros, see Chapter 13.

One should also avoid performing destructive operations on the
expressions returned by macro expanders, if these expressions
incorporate quoted lists. This is not a restriction on macros per se,
but an instance of the principle outlined in Section 3.3.

<<Recursion>><<SEC81>>

** 10.4 Recursion
Sometimes it's natural to define a function recursively. There's
something inherently recursive about a function like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-length (x)
      (if (null x)
          0
        (1+ (our-length (cdr x)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This definition somehow seems more natural (though probably slower) than
the iterative equivalent:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-length (x)
      (do ((len 0 (1+ len))
           (y x (cdr y)))
          ((null y) len)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

A function which is neither recursive, nor part of some mutually
recursive set of functions, can be transformed into a macro by the
simple technique described in Section 7.10. However, just inserting
backquotes and commas won't work with a recursive function. Let's take
the built-in nth as an example. (For simplicity, our versions of nth
will do no error-checking.) Figure 10.2 shows a mistaken attempt to
define nth as a macro. Superficially, nthb appears to be equivalent to
ntha, but a program containing a call to nthb would not compile, because
the expansion of the call would never terminate.

In general, it's fine for macros to contain references to other macros,
so long as expansion terminates somewhere. The trouble with nthb is that
every expansion contains a reference to nthb itself. The function
version, ntha, terminates because it recurses on the value of n, which
is decremented on each recursion. But macroexpansion only has access to
forms, not to their values. When the compiler tries to macroexpand, say,
(nthb x y), the first expansion will yield

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (if (= x 0)
        (car y)
      (nthb (- x 1) (cdr y)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which will in turn expand into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (if (= x 0)
        (car y)
      (if (= (- x 1) 0)
          (car (cdr y))
        (nthb (- (- x 1) 1) (cdr (cdr y)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and so on into an infinite loop. It's fine for a macro to expand into a
call to itself, just so long as it doesn't always do so.

This will work:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun ntha (n lst)
      (if (= n 0)
          (car lst)
        (ntha (- n 1) (cdr lst))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This won't compile:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro nthb (n lst)
      `(if (= ,n 0)
           (car ,lst)
         (nthb (- ,n 1) (cdr ,lst))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 10.2: Mistaken analogy to a recursive function.

<<IDX43>>

The dangerous thing about recursive macros like nthb is that they
usually work fine under the interpreter. Then when you finally have your
program working and you try to compile it, it won't even compile. Not
only that, but there will usually be no indication that the problem is
due to a recursive macro; the compiler will simply go into an infinite
loop and leave you to figure out what went wrong.

In this case, ntha is tail-recursive. A tail-recursive function can
easily be transformed into an iterative equivalent, and then used as a
model for a macro. A macro like nthb could be written

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro nthc (n lst)
      `(do ((n2 ,n (1- n2))
        (lst2 ,lst (cdr lst2)))
           ((= n2 0) (car lst2))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

so it is not impossible in principle to duplicate a recursive function
with a macro. However, transforming more complicated recursive functions
could be difficult, or even impossible.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro nthd (n lst)
      `(nth-fn ,n ,lst))

    (defun nth-fn (n lst)
      (if (= n 0)
          (car lst)
        (nth-fn (- n 1) (cdr lst))))

    (defmacro nthe (n lst)
      `(labels ((nth-fn (n lst)
                (if (= n 0)
                (car lst)
                  (nth-fn (- n 1) (cdr lst)))))
         (nth-fn ,n ,lst)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 10.3: Two ways to fix the problem.

<<IDX44>>

Depending on what you need a macro for, you may find it sufficient to
use instead a combination of macro and function. Figure 10.3 shows two
ways to make what appears to be a recursive macro. The first strategy,
embodied by nthd, is simply to make the macro expand into a call to a
recursive function. If, for example, you need a macro only to save users
the trouble of quoting arguments, then this approach should suffice.

If you need a macro because you want its whole expansion to be inserted
into the lexical environment of the macro call, then you would more
likely want to follow the example of nthe. The built-in labels special
form (Section 2.7) creates a local function definition. While each
expansion of nthc will call the globally defined function nth-fn, each
expansion of nthe will have its own version of such a function within
it.

Although you can't translate a recursive function directly into a macro,
you can write a macro whose expansion is recursively generated. The
expansion function of a macro is a regular Lisp function, and can of
course be recursive. For example, if we were to define a version of the
built-in or, we would want to use a recursive expansion function.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro ora (&rest args)
      (or-expand args))

    (defun or-expand (args)
      (if (null args)
          nil
        (let ((sym (gensym)))
          `(let ((,sym ,(car args)))
         (if ,sym
             ,sym
           ,(or-expand (cdr args)))))))

    (defmacro orb (&rest args)
      (if (null args)
          nil
        (let ((sym (gensym)))
          `(let ((,sym ,(car args)))
         (if ,sym
             ,sym
           (orb ,@(cdr args)))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 10.4: Recursive expansion functions.

<<IDX45>>

Figure 10.4 shows two ways of defining recursive expansion functions for
or. The macro ora calls the recursive function or-expand to generate its
expansion. This macro will work, and so will the equivalent orb.
Although orb recurses, it recurses on the arguments to the macro (which
are available at macroexpansion time), not upon their values (which
aren't). It might seem as if the expansion would contain a reference to
orb itself, but the call to orb generated by one macroexpansion step
will be replaced by a let in the next one, yielding in the final
expansion nothing more than a nested stack of lets; (orb x y) expands
into code equivalent to:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((g2 x))
      (if g2
          g2
        (let ((g3 y))
          (if g3 g3 nil))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

In fact, ora and orb are equivalent, and which style to use is just a
matter of personal preference.

<<SEC82>>

* 11. Classic Macros
This chapter shows how to define the most commonly used types of macros.
They fall into three categories--with a fair amount of overlap. The
first group are macros which create context. Any operator which causes
its arguments to be evaluated in a new context will probably have to be
defined as a macro. The first two sections describe the two basic types
of context, and show how to define macros for each.

The next three sections describe macros for conditional and repeated
evaluation. An operator whose arguments are to be evaluated less than
once, or more than once, must also be defined as a macro. There is no
sharp distinction between operators for conditional and repeated
evaluation: some of the examples in this chapter do both (as well as
binding). The final section explains another similarity between
conditional and repeated evaluation: in some cases, both can be done
with functions.

** 11.1 Creating Context
Context here has two senses. One sort of context is a lexical
environment. The let special form creates a new lexical environment; the
expressions in the body of a let will be evaluated in an environment
which may contain new variables. If x is set to a at the toplevel, then

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x 'b)) (list x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

will nonetheless return (b), because the call to list will be made in an
environment containing a new x, whose value is b.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro our-let (binds &body body)
      `((lambda ,(mapcar #'(lambda (x)
                 (if (consp x) (car x) x))
                 binds)
          ,@body)
        ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (x)
               (if (consp x) (cadr x) nil))
               binds)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 11.1: Macro implementation of let.

An operator which is to have a body of expressions must usually be
defined as a macro. Except for cases like prog1 and progn, the purpose
of such an operator will usually be to cause the body to be evaluated in
some new context. A macro will be needed to wrap context-creating code
around the body, even if the context does not include new lexical
variables.

Figure 11.1 shows how let could be defined as a macro on lambda. An
our-let expands into a function application---

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (our-let ((x 1) (y 2))
         (+ x y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

expands into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ((lambda (x y) (+ x y)) 1 2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 11.2 contains three new macros which establish lexical
environments. Section 7.5 used when-bind as an example of parameter list
destructuring, so this macro has already been described on page 94. The
more general when-bind* takes a list of pairs of the form (symbol
expression)---the same form as the first argument to let. If any
expression returns nil, the whole when-bind* expression returns nil.
Otherwise its body will be evaluated with each symbol bound as if by
let*:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (when-bind* ((x (find-if #'consp '(a (1 2) b)))
    (y (find-if #'oddp x)))
    (+ y 10))
    11
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, the macro with-gensyms is itself for use in writing macros.
Many macro definitions begin with the creation of gensyms, sometimes
quite a number of them. The macro with-redraw (page 115) had to create
five:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-redraw ((var objs) &body body)
      (let ((gob (gensym))
        (x0 (gensym)) (y0 (gensym))
        (x1 (gensym)) (y1 (gensym)))
        ...))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Such definitions are simplified by with-gensyms, which binds a whole
list of variables to gensyms. With the new macro we would write just:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-redraw ((var objs) &body body)
      (with-gensyms (gob x0 y0 x1 y1)
            ...))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro when-bind ((var expr) &body body)
      `(let ((,var ,expr))
         (when ,var
           ,@body)))

    (defmacro when-bind* (binds &body body)
      (if (null binds)
          `(progn ,@body)
        `(let (,(car binds))
           (if ,(caar binds)
           (when-bind* ,(cdr binds) ,@body)))))

    (defmacro with-gensyms (syms &body body)
      `(let ,(mapcar #'(lambda (s)
                 `(,s (gensym)))
             syms)
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 11.2: Macros which bind variables.

<<IDX47>>

This new macro will be used throughout the remaining chapters.

If we want to bind some variables and then, depending on some condition,
evaluate one of a set of expressions, we just use a conditional within a
let:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((sun-place 'park) (rain-place 'library))
      (if (sunny)
          (visit sun-place)
        (visit rain-place)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro condlet (clauses &body body)
      (let ((bodfn (gensym))
        (vars (mapcar #'(lambda (v) (cons v (gensym)))
                  (remove-duplicates
                   (mapcar #'car
                       (mappend #'cdr clauses))))))
        `(labels ((,bodfn ,(mapcar #'car vars)
                  ,@body))
           (cond ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (cl)
                    (condlet-clause vars cl bodfn))
                clauses)))))

    (defun condlet-clause (vars cl bodfn)
      `(,(car cl) (let ,(mapcar #'cdr vars)

                (cdr bindform))))
          (cdr cl)))

Unfortunately, there is no convenient idiom for the opposite situation,
where we always want to evaluate the same code, but where the bindings
must vary depending on some condition.

Figure 11.3 contains a macro intended for such situations. As its name
suggests, condlet behaves like the offspring of cond and let. It takes
as arguments a list of binding clauses, followed by a body of code. Each
of the binding clauses is guarded by a test expression; the body of code
will be evaluated with the bindings specified by the first binding
clause whose test expression returns true. Variables which occur in some
clauses and not others will be bound to nil if the successful clause
does not specify bindings for them:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (condlet (((= 1 2) (x (princ 'a)) (y (princ 'b)))
    ((= 1 1) (y (princ 'c)) (x (princ 'd)))
    (t (x (princ 'e)) (z (princ 'f))))
    (list x y z))
    CD
    (D C NIL)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The definition of condlet can be understood as a generalization of the
definition of our-let. The latter makes its body into a function, which
is applied to the results of evaluating the initial-value forms. A
condlet expands into code which defines a local function with labels;
within it a cond clause determines which set of initial-value forms will
be evaluated and passed to the function.

Notice that the expander uses mappend instead of mapcan to extract the
variable names from the binding clauses. This is because mapcan is
destructive, and as Section 10.3 warned, it is dangerous to modify
parameter list structure.

<<The with- Macro>><<SEC84>>

** 11.2 The with- Macro
There is another kind of context besides a lexical environment. In the
broader sense, the context is the state of the world, including the
values of special variables, the contents of data structures, and the
state of things outside Lisp. Operators which build this kind of context
must be defined as macros too, unless their code bodies are to be
packaged up in closures.

The names of context-building macros often begin with with-. The most
commonly used macro of this type is probably with-open-file. Its body is
evaluated with a newly opened file bound to a user-supplied variable:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (with-open-file (s "dump" :direction :output)
            (princ 99 s))
#+END_EXAMPLE

After evaluation of this expression the file "dump" will automatically
be closed, and its contents will be the two characters "99".

This operator clearly has to be defined as a macro,because it binds s.
However, operators which cause forms to be evaluated in a new context
must be defined as macros anyway. The ignore-errors macro, new in CLTL2,
causes its arguments to be evaluated as if in a progn. If an error
occurs at any point, the whole ignore-errors form simply returns nil.
(This would be useful, for example, when reading input typed by the
user.) Though ignore-errors creates no variables, it still must be
defined as a macro, because its arguments are evaluated in a new
context.

Generally, macros which create context will expand into a block of code;
additional expressions may be placed before the body, after it, or both.
If code occurs after the body, its purpose may be to leave the system in
a consistent state--to clean up something. For example, with-open-file
has to close the file it opened. In such situations, it is typical to
make the context-creating macro expand into an unwind-protect.

The purpose of unwind-protect is to ensure that certain expressions are
evaluated even if execution is interrupted. It takes one or more
arguments, which are evaluated in order. If all goes smoothly it will
return the value of the first argument, like a prog1. The difference is,
the remaining arguments will be evaluated even if an error or throw
interrupts evaluation of the first.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq x 'a)
    A
    > (unwind-protect
    (progn (princ "What error?")
    (error "This error."))
    (setq x 'b))
    What error?
    >>Error: This error.
#+END_EXAMPLE

The unwind-protect form as a whole yields an error. However, after
returning to the toplevel, we notice that the second argument still got
evaluated:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > x
    B
#+END_EXAMPLE

Because with-open-file expands into an unwind-protect, the file it opens
will usually be closed even if an error occurs during the evaluation of
its body.

Context-creating macros are mostly written for specific applications. As
an example, suppose we are writing a program which deals with multiple,
remote databases. The program talks to one database at a time, indicated
by the global variable *db*. Before using a database, we have to lock
it, so that no one else can use it at the same time. When we are
finished we have to release the lock. If we want the value of the query
q on the database db, we might say something like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((temp *db*))
      (setq *db* db)
      (lock *db*)
      (prog1 (eval-query q)
        (release *db*)
        (setq *db* temp)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

With a macro we can hide all this bookkeeping. Figure 11.4 defines a
macro which will allow us to deal with databases at a higher level of
abstraction. Using with-db, we would say just:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (with-db db
         (eval-query q))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Pure macro:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-db (db &body body)
      (let ((temp (gensym)))
        `(let ((,temp *db*))
           (unwind-protect
           (progn
             (setq *db* ,db)
             (lock *db*)
             ,@body)
         (progn
           (release *db*)
           (setq *db* ,temp))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Combination of macro and function:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-db (db &body body)
      (let ((gbod (gensym)))
        `(let ((,gbod #'(lambda () ,@body)))
           (declare (dynamic-extent ,gbod))
           (with-db-fn *db* ,db ,gbod))))

    (defun with-db-fn (old-db new-db body)
      (unwind-protect
          (progn
        (setq *db* new-db)
        (lock *db*)
        (funcall body))
        (progn
          (release *db*)
          (setq *db* old-db))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 11.4: A typical with- macro.

<<IDX49>>

Calling with-db is also safer, because it expands into an unwind-protect
instead of a simple prog1.

The two definitions of with-db in Figure 11.4 illustrate two possible
ways to write this kind of macro. The first is a pure macro, the second
a combination of a function and a macro. The second approach becomes
more practical as the desired with- macro grows in complexity.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro if3 (test t-case nil-case ?-case)
      `(case ,test
         ((nil) ,nil-case)
         (? ,?-case)
         (t ,t-case)))

    (defmacro nif (expr pos zero neg)
      (let ((g (gensym)))
        `(let ((,g ,expr))
           (cond ((plusp ,g) ,pos)
             ((zerop ,g) ,zero)
             (t ,neg)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 11.5: Macros for conditional evaluation.

<<IDX50>>

In CLTL2 Common Lisp, the dynamic-extent declaration allows the closure
containing the body to be allocated more efficiently (in CLTL1
implementations, it will be ignored). We only need this closure for the
duration of the call to with-db-fn, and the declaration says as much,
allowing the compiler to allocate space for it on the stack. This space
will be reclaimed automatically on exit from the let expression, instead
of being reclaimed later by the garbage-collector.

<<Conditional Evaluation>><<SEC85>>

** 11.3 Conditional Evaluation
Sometimes we want an argument in a macro call to be evaluated only under
certain conditions. This is beyond the ability of functions, which
always evaluate all their arguments. Built-in operators like if, and,
and cond protect some of their arguments from evaluation unless other
arguments return certain values. For example, in this expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (if t
        'phew
      (/ x 0))
#+END_EXAMPLE

the third argument would cause a division-by-zero error if it were
evaluated. But since only the first two arguments ever will be
evaluated, the if as a whole will always safely return phew.

We can create new operators of this sort by writing macros which expand
into calls to the existing ones. The two macros in Figure 11.5 are two
of many possible variations on if. The definition of if3 shows how we
could define a conditional for a three-valued logic. Instead of treating
nil as false and everything else as true, this macro considers three
categories of truth: true, false, and uncertain, represented as ?. It
might be used as in the following description of a five year-old:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (while (not sick)
      (if3 (cake-permitted)
           (eat-cake)
           (throw 'tantrum nil)
           (plead-insistently)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The new conditional expands into a case. (The nil key has to be enclosed
within a list because a nil key alone would be ambiguous.) Only one of
the last three arguments will be evaluated, depending on the value of
the first.

The name nif stands for "numeric if." Another implementation of this
macro appeared on page 86. It takes a numeric expression as its first
argument, and depending on its sign evaluates one of the remaining three
arguments.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapcar #'(lambda (x)
    (nif x 'p 'z 'n))
    '(0 1 -1))
    (Z P N)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 11.6 contains several more macros which take advantage of
conditional evaluation. The macro in is to test efficiently for set
membership. When you want to test whether an object is one of a set of
alternatives, you could express the query as a disjunction:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x (foo)))
      (or (eql x (bar)) (eql x (baz))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

or you could express it in terms of set membership:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (member (foo) (list (bar) (baz)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The latter is more abstract, but less efficient. The member expression
incurs unnecessary costs from two sources. It conses, because it must
assemble the alternatives into a list for member to search. And to form
the alternatives into a list they all have to be evaluated, even though
some of the values may never be needed. If the value of (foo) is equal
to the value of (bar), then there is no need to evaluate (baz). Whatever
its conceptual advantages, this is not a good way to use member. We can
get the same abstraction more efficiently with a macro: in combines the
abstraction of member with the efficiency of or. The equivalent in
expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (in (foo) (bar) (baz))
#+END_EXAMPLE

has the same shape as the member expression, but expands into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((#:g25 (foo)))
      (or (eql #:g25 (bar))
          (eql #:g25 (baz))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro in (obj &rest choices)
      (let ((insym (gensym)))
        `(let ((,insym ,obj))
           (or ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (c) `(eql ,insym ,c))
                  choices)))))

    (defmacro inq (obj &rest args)
      `(in ,obj ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (a)
                   `',a)
                   args)))

    (defmacro in-if (fn &rest choices)
      (let ((fnsym (gensym)))
        `(let ((,fnsym ,fn))
           (or ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (c)
                  `(funcall ,fnsym ,c))
                  choices)))))

    (defmacro >case (expr &rest clauses)
      (let ((g (gensym)))
        `(let ((,g ,expr))
           (cond ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (cl) (>casex g cl))
                clauses)))))

    (defun >casex (g cl)
      (let ((key (car cl)) (rest (cdr cl)))
        (cond ((consp key) `((in ,g ,@key) ,@rest))
          ((inq key t otherwise) `(t ,@rest))
          (t (error "bad >case clause")))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 11.6: Macros for conditional evaluation.

<<IDX51>>

As is often the case, when faced with a choice between a clean idiom and
an efficient one, we go between the horns of the dilemma by writing a
macro which transforms the former into the latter.

Pronounced "in queue," inq is a quoting variant of in, as setq used to
be of set. The expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (inq operator + - *)
#+END_EXAMPLE

expands into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (in operator '+ '- '*)
#+END_EXAMPLE

As member does by default, in and inq use eql to test for equality. When
you want to use some other test--or any other function of one
argument--you can use the more general in-if. What in is to member,
in-if is to some. The expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (member x (list a b) :test #'equal)
#+END_EXAMPLE

can be duplicated by

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (in-if #'(lambda (y) (equal x y)) a b)
#+END_EXAMPLE

and

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (some #'oddp (list a b))
#+END_EXAMPLE

becomes

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (in-if #'oddp a b)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Using a combination of cond and in, we can define a useful variant of
case. The Common Lisp case macro assumes that its keys are constants.
Sometimes we may want the behavior of a case expression, but with keys
which are evaluated. For such situations we define >case, like case
except that the keys guarding each clause are evaluated before
comparison. (The > in the name is intended to suggest the arrow notation
used to represent evaluation.) Because >case uses in, it evaluates no
more of the keys than it needs to.

Since keys can be Lisp expressions, there is no way to tell if (x y) is
a call or a list of two keys. To avoid ambiguity, keys (other than t and
otherwise) must always be given in a list, even if there is only one of
them. In case expressions, nil may not appear as the car of a clause on
grounds of ambiguity. In a >case expression, nil is no longer ambiguous
as the car of a clause, but it does mean that the rest of the clause
will never be evaluated.

For clarity, the code that generates the expansion of each >case clause
is defined as a separate function, >casex. Notice that >casex itself
uses inq.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro while (test &body body)
      `(do ()
           ((not ,test))
         ,@body))

    (defmacro till (test &body body)
      `(do ()
           (,test)
         ,@body))

    (defmacro for ((var start stop) &body body)
      (let ((gstop (gensym)))
        `(do ((,var ,start (1+ ,var))
          (,gstop ,stop))
         ((> ,var ,gstop))
           ,@body)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 11.7: Simple iteration macros.

<<IDX52>>

<<Iteration>><<SEC86>>

** 11.4 Iteration
Sometimes the trouble with functions is not that their arguments are
always evaluated, but that they are evaluated only once. Because each
argument to a function will be evaluated exactly once, if we want to
define an operator which takes some body of expressions and iterates
through them, we will have to define it as a macro.

The simplest example would be a macro which evaluated its arguments in
sequence forever:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro forever (&body body)
      `(do ()
           (nil)
         ,@body))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is just what the built-in loop macro does if you give it no loop
keywords. It might seem that there is not much future (or too much
future) in looping forever. But combined with block and return-from,
this kind of macro becomes the most natural way to express loops where
termination is always in the nature of an emergency.

Some of the simplest macros for iteration are shown in Figure 11.7. We
have already seen while (page 91), whose body will be evaluated while a
test expression returns true. Its converse is till, which does the same
while a test expression returns false. Finally for, also seen before
(page 129), iterates for a range of numbers.

By defining these macros to expand into dos, we enable the use of go and
return within their bodies. As do inherits these rights from block and
tagbody, while, till, and for inherit them from do. As explained on page
131, the nil tag of the implicit block around do will be captured by the
macros defined in Figure 11.7. This is more of a feature than a bug, but
it should at least be mentioned explicitly.

Macros are indispensable when we need to define more powerful iteration
constructs. Figure 11.8 contains two generalizations of dolist; both
evaluate their body with a tuple of variables bound to successive
subsequences of a list. For example, given two parameters, do-tuples/o
will iterate by pairs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (do-tuples/o (x y) '(a b c d)
    (princ (list x y)))
    (A B)(B C)(C D)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Given the same arguments, do-tuples/c will do the same thing, then wrap
around to the front of the list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (do-tuples/c (x y) '(a b c d)
    (princ (list x y)))
    (A B)(B C)(C D)(D A)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Both macros return nil, unless an explicit return occurs within the
body.

This kind of iteration is often needed in programs which deal with some
notion of a path. The suffixes /o and /c are intended to suggest that
the two versions traverse open and closed paths, respectively. For
example, if points is a list of points and (drawline x y) draws the line
between x and y, then to draw the path from the first point to the last
we write.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (do-tuples/o (x y) points (drawline x y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

whereas, if points is a list of the vertices of a polygon, to draw its
perimeter we write

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (do-tuples/c (x y) points (drawline x y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The list of parameters given as the first argument can be any length,
and iteration will proceed by tuples of that length. If just one
parameter is given, both degenerate to dolist:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (do-tuples/o (x) '(a b c) (princ x))
    ABC
    NIL
    > (do-tuples/c (x) '(a b c) (princ x))
    ABC
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<IDX54>>

The definition of do-tuples/c is more complex than that of do-tuples/o,
because it has to wrap around on reaching the end of the list. If there
are n parameters, do-tuples/c must do n-1 more iterations before
returning:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (do-tuples/c (x y z) '(a b c d)
    (princ (list x y z)))
    (A B C)(B C D)(C D A)(D A B)
    NIL
    > (do-tuples/c (w x y z) '(a b c d)
    (princ (list w x y z)))
    (A B C D)(B C D A)(C D A B)(D A B C)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

The expansion of the former call to do-tuples/c is shown in Figure 11.9.
The hard part to generate is the sequence of calls representing the wrap
around to the front of the list. These calls (in this case, two of them)
are generated by dt-args.

<<Iteration with Multiple Values>><<SEC87>>

** 11.5 Iteration with Multiple Values
The built-in do macros have been around longer than multiple return
values. Fortunately do can evolve to suit the new situation, because the
evolution of Lisp is in the hands of the programmer. Figure 11.10
contains a version of do* adapted for multiple values. With mvdo*, each
of the initial clauses can bind more than one variable:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mvdo* ((x 1 (1+ x))
    ((y z) (values 0 0) (values z x)))
    ((> x 5) (list x y z))
    (princ (list x y z)))
    (1 0 0)(2 0 2)(3 2 3)(4 3 4)(5 4 5)
    (6 5 6)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This kind of iteration is useful, for example, in interactive graphics
programs, which often have to deal with multiple quantities like
coordinates and regions.

Suppose that we want to write a simple interactive game, in which the
object is to avoid being squashed between two pursuing objects. If the
two pursuers both hit you at the same time, you lose; if they crash into
one another first, you win. Figure 11.11 shows how the main loop of this
game could be written using mvdo*.

It is also possible to write an mvdo, which binds its local variables in
parallel:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mvdo ((x 1 (1+ x))
    ((y z) (values 0 0) (values z x)))
    ((> x 5) (list x y z))
    (princ (list x y z)))
    (1 0 0)(2 0 1)(3 1 2)(4 2 3)(5 3 4)
    (6 4 5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The need for psetq in defining do was described on page 96. To define
mvdo, we need a multiple-value version of psetq. Since Common Lisp
doesn't have one, we have to write it ourselves, as in Figure 11.12. The
new macro works as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((w 0) (x 1) (y 2) (z 3))
    (mvpsetq (w x) (values 'a 'b) (y z) (values w x))
    (list w x y z))
    (A B 0 1)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro mvdo* (parm-cl test-cl &body body)
      (mvdo-gen parm-cl parm-cl test-cl body))

    (defun mvdo-gen (binds rebinds test body)
      (if (null binds)
          (let ((label (gensym)))
        `(prog nil
               ,label
               (if ,(car test)
               (return (progn ,@(cdr test))))
               ,@body
               ,@(mvdo-rebind-gen rebinds)
               (go ,label)))
        (let ((rec (mvdo-gen (cdr binds) rebinds test body)))
          (let ((var/s (caar binds)) (expr (cadar binds)))
        (if (atom var/s)
            `(let ((,var/s ,expr)) ,rec)
          `(multiple-value-bind ,var/s ,expr ,rec))))))

    (defun mvdo-rebind-gen (rebinds)
      (cond ((null rebinds) nil)
        ((< (length (car rebinds)) 3)
         (mvdo-rebind-gen (cdr rebinds)))
        (t
         (cons (list (if (atom (caar rebinds))
                 'setq
                   'multiple-value-setq)
                 (caar rebinds)
                 (third (car rebinds)))
               (mvdo-rebind-gen (cdr rebinds))))))

The definition of mvpsetq relies on three utility functions: mklist
(page 45), group (page 47), and shuffle, defined here, which interleaves
two lists:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mvdo* (((px py) (pos player) (move player mx my))
        ((x1 y1) (pos obj1) (move obj1 (- px x1)
                      (- py y1)))
        ((x2 y2) (pos obj2) (move obj2 (- px x2)
                      (- py y2)))
        ((mx my) (mouse-vector) (mouse-vector))
        (win nil (touch obj1 obj2))
        (lose nil (and (touch obj1 player)
                   (touch obj2 player))))
           ((or win lose) (if win 'win 'lose))
           (clear)
           (draw obj1)
           (draw obj2)
           (draw player))
#+END_EXAMPLE

(pos obj) returns two values x,y representing the position of obj.
Initially, the three objects have random positions.

(move obj dx dy) moves the object obj depending on its type and the
vector #dx,dy#. Returns two values x,y indicating the new position.
(mouse-vector) returns two values dx,dy indicating the current movement
of the mouse.

(touch obj1 obj2) returns true if obj1 and obj2 are touching. (clear)
clears the game region.

(draw obj) draws obj at its current position.

With mvpsetq, we can define mvdo as in Figure 11.13. Like condlet, this
macro uses mappend instead of mapcar to avoid modifying the original
macro call. The mappend-mklist idiom flattens a tree by one level:

                       (mklist (car p))))

                           (shuffle (mklist (car p))
                            s))
                       pairs syms))
                (let ((body (rec (cdr ps) (cdr ss))))
                  (let ((var/s (caar ps))
                    (expr (cadar ps)))
                (if (consp var/s)

                     ,body)))))))
          (rec pairs syms))))

    (defun shuffle (x y)

Macros aren't the only way to protect arguments against evaluation.
Another is to wrap them in closures. Conditional and repeated evaluation
are similar because neither problem inherently requires macros. For
example, we could write a version of if as a function:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun fnif (test then &optional else)
      (if test
          (funcall then)
        (if else (funcall else))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

We would protect the then and else arguments by expressing them as
closures, so instead of

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (if (rich) (go-sailing) (rob-bank))
#+END_EXAMPLE

we would say

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (fnif (rich)
          #'(lambda () (go-sailing))
          #'(lambda () (rob-bank)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mvdo ((x 1 (1+ x))
           ((y z) (values 0 0) (values z x)))
          ((> x 5) (list x y z))
          (princ (list x y z)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

expands into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let (#:g2 #:g3 #:g4)
      (mvpsetq #:g2 1
           (#:g3 #:g4) (values 0 0))
      (prog ((x #:g2) (y #:g3) (z #:g4))
        #:g1
        (if (> x 5)
            (return (progn (list x y z))))
        (princ (list x y z))
        (mvpsetq x (1+ x)
             (y z) (values z x))
        (go #:g1)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<IDX59>>

If all we want is conditional evaluation, macros aren't absolutely
necessary. They just make programs cleaner. However, macros are
necessary when we want to take apart argument forms, or bind variables
passed as arguments.

The same applies to macros for iteration. Although macros offer the only
way to define an iteration construct which can be followed by a body of
expressions, it is possible to do iteration with functions, so long as
the body of the loop is packaged up in a function
itself.[fn:25] The built-in function mapc, for example, is
the functional counterpart of dolist. The expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (dolist (b bananas)
      (peel b)
      (eat b))
#+END_EXAMPLE

has the same side-effects as

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (mapc #'(lambda (b)
          (peel b)
          (eat b))
          bananas)
#+END_EXAMPLE

(though the former returns nil and the latter returns the list bananas).
We could likewise implement forever as a function,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun forever (fn)
      (do ()
          (nil)
        (funcall fn)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

if we were willing to pass it a closure instead of a body of
expressions.

However, iteration constructs usually want to do more than just iterate,
as forever does: they usually want to do a combination of binding and
iteration. With a function, the prospects for binding are limited. If
you want to bind variables to successive elements of lists, you can use
one of the mapping functions. But if the requirements get much more
complicated than that, you'll have to write a macro.

<<SEC89>>

* 12. Generalized Variables
Chapter 8 mentioned that one of the advantages of macros is their
ability to transform their arguments. One macro of this sort is setf.
This chapter looks at the implications of setf, and then shows some
examples of macros which can be built upon it.

Writing correct macros on setf is surprisingly difficult. To introduce
the topic, the first section will provide a simple example which is
slightly incorrect. The next section will explain what's wrong with this
macro, and show how to fix it. The third and fourth sections present
examples of utilities built on setf, and the final section explains how
to define your own setf inversions.

** 12.1 The Concept
The built-in macro setf is a generalization of setq. The first argument
to setf can be a call instead of just a variable:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq lst '(a b c))
    (A B C)
    > (setf (car lst) 480)
    480
    > lst
    (480 B C)
#+END_EXAMPLE

In general (setf x y) can be understood as saying "see to it that x
evaluates to y." As a macro, setf can look inside its arguments to see
what needs to be done to make such a statement true. If the first
argument (after macroexpansion) is a symbol, the setf just expands into
a setq. But if the first argument is a query, the setf expands into the
corresponding assertion. Since the second argument is a constant, the
preceding example could expand into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (progn (rplaca lst 480) 480)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This transformation from query to assertion is called inversion. All the
most frequently used Common Lisp access functions have predefined
inversions, including car, cdr, nth, aref, get, gethash, and the access
functions created by defstruct. (The full list is in CLTL2, p. 125.)

An expression which can serve as the first argument to setf is called a
generalized variable. Generalized variables have turned out to be a
powerful abstraction. A macro call resembles a generalized variable in
that any macro call which expands into an invertible reference will
itself be invertible.

When we also write our own macros on top of setf, the combination leads
to noticeably cleaner programs. One of the macros we can define on top
of setf is toggle,[fn:26]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro toggle (obj)            ; wrong
      `(setf ,obj (not ,obj)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which toggles the value of a generalized variable:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((lst '(a b c)))
    (toggle (car lst))
    lst)
    (NIL B C)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now consider the following sample application. Suppose someone--a
soap-opera writer, energetic busybody, or party official--wants to
maintain a database of all the relations between the inhabitants of a
small town. Among the tables required is one which records people's
friends:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defvar *friends* (make-hash-table))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The entries in this hash-table are themselves hash-tables, in which
names of potential friends are mapped to t or nil:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (gethash 'mary *friends*) (make-hash-table))
#+END_EXAMPLE

To make John the friend of Mary, we would say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (gethash 'john (gethash 'mary *friends*)) t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The town is divided between two factions. As factions are wont to do,
each says "anyone who is not with us is against us," so everyone in town
has been compelled to join one side or the other. Thus when someone
switches sides, all his friends become enemies and all his enemies
become friends.

To toggle whether x is the friend of y using only built-in operators, we
have to say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (gethash x (gethash y *friends*))
          (not (gethash x (gethash y *friends*))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which is a rather complicated expression, though much simpler than it
would have been without setf. If we had defined an access macro upon the
database as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro friend-of (p q)
      `(gethash ,p (gethash ,q *friends*)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then between this macro and toggle, we would have been better equipped
to deal with changes to the database. The previous update could have
been expressed as simply:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (toggle (friend-of x y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Generalized variables are like a health food that tastes good. They
yield programs which are virtuously modular, and yet beautifully
elegant. If you provide access to your data structures through macros or
invertible functions, other modules can use setf to modify your data
structures without having to know the details of their representation.

<<The Multiple Evaluation Problem>><<SEC91>>

** 12.2 The Multiple Evaluation Problem
The previous section warned that our initial definition of toggle was
incorrect:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro toggle (obj)            ; wrong
      `(setf ,obj (not ,obj)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is subject to the problem described in Section 10.1, multiple
evaluation. Trouble arises when its argument has side-effects. For
example, if lst is a list of objects, and we write:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (toggle (nth (incf i) lst))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then we would expect to be toggling the (i+1)th element. However, with
the current definition of toggle this call will expand into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (nth (incf i) lst)
          (not (nth (incf i) lst)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This increments i twice, and sets the (i+1)th element to the opposite of
the (i+2)th element. So in this example

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((lst '(t nil t))
    (i -1))
    (toggle (nth (incf i) lst))
    lst)
    (T NIL T)
#+END_EXAMPLE

the call to toggle seems to have no effect.

It is not enough just to take the expression given as an argument to
toggle and insert it as the first argument to setf. We have to look
inside the expression to see what it does: if it contains subforms, we
have to break them apart and evaluate them separately, in case they have
side effects. In general, this is a complicated business.

To make it easier, Common Lisp provides a macro which automatically
defines a limited class of macros on setf. This macro is called
define-modify-macro, and it takes three arguments: the name of the
macro, its additional parameters (after the generalized variable), and
the name of the function[fn:27] which yields the new value
for the generalized variable.

Using define-modify-macro, we could define toggle as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define-modify-macro toggle () not)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Paraphrased, this says "to evaluate an expression of the form (toggle
place), find the location specified by place, and if the value stored
there is val, replace it with the value of (not val)." Here is the new
macro used in the same example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((lst '(t nil t))
    (i -1))
    (toggle (nth (incf i) lst))
    lst)
    (NIL NIL T)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This version gives the correct result, but it could be made more
general. Since setf and setq can take an arbitrary number of arguments,
so should toggle. We can add this capability by defining another macro
on top of the modify-macro, as in Figure 12.1.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro allf (val &rest args)
      (with-gensyms (gval)
            `(let ((,gval ,val))
               (setf ,@(mapcan #'(lambda (a) (list a gval))
                        args)))))

    (defmacro nilf (&rest args) `(allf nil ,@args))

    (defmacro tf (&rest args) `(allf t ,@args))

    (defmacro toggle (&rest args)
      `(progn
         ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (a) `(toggle2 ,a))
            args)))

    (define-modify-macro toggle2 () not)
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<IDX60>>

<<New Utilities>><<SEC92>>

** 12.3 New Utilities
This section gives some examples of new utilities which operate on
generalized variables. They must be macros in order to pass their
arguments intact to setf.

Figure 12.1 shows four new macros built upon setf. The first, allf, is
for setting a number of generalized variables to the same value. Upon it
are built nilf and tf, which set their arguments to nil and t,
respectively. These macros are simple, but they make a difference.

Like setq, setf can take multiple arguments--alternating variables and
values:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf x 1 y 2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

So can these new utilities, but you can skip giving half the arguments.
If you want to initialize a number of variables to nil, instead of

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf x nil y nil z nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

you can say just

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (nilf x y z)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define-modify-macro concf (obj) nconc)

    (define-modify-macro conc1f (obj)
      (lambda (place obj)
        (nconc place (list obj))))

    (define-modify-macro concnew (obj &rest args)
      (lambda (place obj &rest args)
        (unless (apply #'member obj place args)
          (nconc place (list obj)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 12.2: List operations on generalized variables.

<<IDX61>>

The last macro, toggle, was described in the previous section: it is
like nilf, but gives each of its arguments the opposite truth value.

These four macros illustrate an important point about operators for
assignment. Even if we only intend to use an operator on ordinary
variables, it's worth writing it to expand into a setf instead of a
setq. If the first argument is a symbol, the setf will expand into a
setq anyway. Since we can have the generality of setf at no extra cost,
it is rarely desirable to use setq in a macroexpansion.

Figure 12.2 contains three macros for destructively modifying the ends
of lists. Section 3.1 mentioned that it is unsafe to rely on

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (nconc x y)
#+END_EXAMPLE

for side-effects, and that one must write instead

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq x (nconc x y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This idiom is embodied in concf. The more specialized conc1f and concnew
are like push and pushnew for the other end of the list: conc1f adds one
element to the end of a list, and concnew does the same, but only if the
element is not already a member.

Section 2.2 mentioned that the name of a function can be a
lambda-expression as well as a symbol. Thus it is fine to give a whole
lambda-expression as the third argument to define-modify-macro, as in
the definition of conc1f. Using conc1 from page 45, this macro could
also have been written:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define-modify-macro conc1f (obj) conc1)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The macros in Figure 12.2 should be used with one reservation. If you're
planning to build a list by adding elements to the end, it may be
preferable to use push, and then nreverse the list. It is cheaper to do
something to the front of a list than to the end, because to do
something to the end you have to get there first. It is probably to
encourage efficient programming that Common Lisp has many operators for
the former and few for the latter.

<<More Complex Utilities>><<SEC93>>

** 12.4 More Complex Utilities
Not all macros on setf can be defined with define-modify-macro. Suppose,
for example, that wewant to define a macro f for applying a function
destructively to a generalized variable. The built-in macro incf is an
abbreviation for setf of +. Instead of

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf x (+ x y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

we say just

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (incf x y)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The new f is to be a generalization of this idea: while incf expands
into a call to +, f will expand into a call to the operator given as the
first argument. For example, in the definition of scale-objs on page
115, we had to write

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (obj-dx o) (* (obj-dx o) factor))
#+END_EXAMPLE

With f this will become

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (_f * (obj-dx o) factor)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The incorrect way to write f would be:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro _f (op place &rest args)  ; wrong
      `(setf ,place (,op ,place ,@args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Unfortunately, we can't define a correct f with
define-modify-macro,because the operator to be applied to the
generalized variable is given as an argument.

More complex macros like this one have to be written by hand. To make
such macros easier to write, Common Lisp provides the function
get-setf-method, which takes a generalized variable and returns all the
information necessary to retrieve or set its value. We will see how to
use this information by hand-generating an expansion for:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (incf (aref a (incf i)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

When we call get-setf-method on the generalized variable, we get five
values intended for use as ingredients in the macroexpansion:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (get-setf-method '(aref a (incf i)))
    (#:G4 #:G5)
    (A (INCF I))
    (#:G6)
    (SYSTEM:SET-AREF #:G6 #:G4 #:G5)
    (AREF #:G4 #:G5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The first two values are lists of temporary variables and the values
that should be assigned to them. So we can begin the expansion with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let* ((#:g4 a)
           (#:g5 (incf i)))
      ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

These bindings should be created in a let* because in the general case
the value forms can refer to earlier variables. The
third[fn:28] and fifth values are another temporary
variable and the form that will return the original value of the
generalized variable. Since we want to add 1 to this value, we wrap the
latter in a call to 1+:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let* ((#:g4 a)
           (#:g5 (incf i))
           (#:g6 (1+ (aref #:g4 #:g5))))
      ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, the fourth value returned by get-setf-method is the assignment
that must be made within the scope of the new bindings:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let* ((#:g4 a)
           (#:g5 (incf i))
           (#:g6 (1+ (aref #:g4 #:g5))))
      (system:set-aref #:g6 #:g4 #:g5))
#+END_EXAMPLE

More often than not, this form will refer to internal functions which
are not part of Common Lisp. Usually setf masks the presence of these
functions, but they have to exist somewhere. Everything about them is
implementation-dependent, so portable code should use forms returned by
get-setf-method, rather than referring directly to functions like
system:set-aref.

Now to implement f we write a macro which does almost exactly what we
did when expanding incf by hand. The only difference is that, instead of
wrapping the last form in the let* in a call to 1+, we wrap it in an
expression made from the arguments to f. The definition of f is shown in
Figure 12.3.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro _f (op place &rest args)
      (multiple-value-bind (vars forms var set access)
          (get-setf-method place)
        `(let* (,@(mapcar #'list vars forms)
               (,(car var) (,op ,access ,@args)))
           ,set)))

    (defmacro pull (obj place &rest args)
      (multiple-value-bind (vars forms var set access)
          (get-setf-method place)
        (let ((g (gensym)))
          `(let* ((,g ,obj)
              ,@(mapcar #'list vars forms)
              (,(car var) (delete ,g ,access ,@args)))
         ,set))))

    (defmacro pull-if (test place &rest args)
      (multiple-value-bind (vars forms var set access)
          (get-setf-method place)
        (let ((g (gensym)))
          `(let* ((,g ,test)
              ,@(mapcar #'list vars forms)
              (,(car var) (delete-if ,g ,access ,@args)))
         ,set))))

    (defmacro popn (n place)
      (multiple-value-bind (vars forms var set access)
          (get-setf-method place)
        (with-gensyms (gn glst)
              `(let* ((,gn ,n)
                  ,@(mapcar #'list vars forms)
                  (,glst ,access)
                  (,(car var) (nthcdr ,gn ,glst)))
                 (prog1 (subseq ,glst 0 ,gn)
                   ,set)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 12.3: More complex macros on setf.

<<IDX62>>

This utility is quite a useful one. Now that we have it, for example, we
can easily replace any named function with a memoized (Section 5.3)
equivalent.[fn:29] To memoize foo we would say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (_f memoize (symbol-function 'foo))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Having f also makes it easy to define other macros on setf. For example,
we could now define conc1f (Figure 12.2) as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro conc1f (lst obj)
      `(_f nconc ,lst (list ,obj)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 12.3 contains some other useful macros on setf. The next, pull,
is intended as a complement to the built-in pushnew. The pair are like
more discerning versions of push and pop; pushnew pushes a new element
onto a list if it is not already a member, and pull destructively
removes selected elements from a list. The &rest parameter in pull's
definition makes pull able to accept all the same keyword parameters as
delete:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq x '(1 2 (a b) 3))
    (1 2 (A B) 3)
    > (pull 2 x)
    (1 (A B) 3)
    > (pull '(a b) x :test #'equal)
    (1 3)
    > x
    (1 3)
#+END_EXAMPLE

You could almost think of this macro as if it were defined:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro pull (obj seq &rest args)    ; wrong
      `(setf ,seq (delete ,obj ,seq ,@args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

though if it really were defined that way, it would be subject to
problems with both order and number of evaluations. We could define a
version of pull as a simple modify-macro:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define-modify-macro pull (obj &rest args)
      (lambda (seq obj &rest args)
        (apply #'delete obj seq args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

but since modify-macros must take the generalized variable as their
first argument, we would have to give the first two arguments in reverse
order, which would be less intuitive.

The more general pull-if takes an initial function argument, and expands
into a delete-if instead of a delete:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((lst '(1 2 3 4 5 6)))
    (pull-if #'oddp lst)
    lst)
    (2 4 6)
#+END_EXAMPLE

These two macros illustrate another general point. If the underlying
function takes optional arguments, so should the macro built upon it.
Both pull and pull-if pass optional arguments on to their deletes.

The final macro in Figure 12.3, popn, is a generalization of pop.
Instead of popping just one element of a list, it pops and returns a
subsequence of arbitrary length:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq x '(a b c d e f))
    (A B C D E F)
    > (popn 3 x)
    (A B C)
    > x
    (D E F)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 12.4 contains a macro which sorts its arguments. If x and y are
variables

and we want to ensure that x does not have the lower of the two values,
we can write:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (if (> y x) (rotatef x y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

But if we want to do this for three or more variables, the code required
grows rapidly. Instead of writing it by hand, we can have sortf write it
for us. This macro takes a comparison operator plus any number of
generalized variables, and swaps their values until they are in the
order dictated by the operator. In the simplest case, the arguments
could be ordinary variables:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq x 1 y 2 z 3)
    3
    > (sortf > x y z)
    3
    > (list x y z)
    (3 2 1)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro sortf (op &rest places)
      (let* ((meths (mapcar #'(lambda (p)
                    (multiple-value-list
                     (get-setf-method p)))
                places))
         (temps (apply #'append (mapcar #'third meths))))
        `(let* ,(mapcar #'list
                (mapcan #'(lambda (m)
                    (append (first m)
                        (third m)))
                    meths)
                (mapcan #'(lambda (m)
                    (append (second m)
                        (list (fifth m))))
                    meths))
           ,@(mapcon #'(lambda (rest)
                  (mapcar
                   #'(lambda (arg)
                   `(unless (,op ,(car rest) ,arg)
                      (rotatef ,(car rest) ,arg)))
                   (cdr rest)))
              temps)
           ,@(mapcar #'fourth meths))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<IDX63>>

In general, they could be any invertible expressions. Suppose cake is an
invertible function which returns someone's piece of cake, and bigger is
a comparison function defined on pieces of cake. If we want to enforce
the rule that the cake of moe is no less than the cake of larry, which
is no less than that of curly, we write:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (sortf bigger (cake 'moe) (cake 'larry) (cake 'curly))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The definition of sortf is similar in outline to that of f. It begins
with a let* in which the temporary variables returned by get-setf-method
are bound to the initial values of the generalized variables. The core
of sortf is the central mapcon expression, which generates code to sort
these temporary variables. The code generated by this portion of the
macro grows exponentially with the number of arguments. After sorting,
the generalized variables are reassigned using the forms returned by
get-setf-method. The algorithm used is the O(n 2 ) bubble-sort, but this
macro is not intended to be called with huge numbers of arguments.

Figure 12.5 shows the expansion of a call to sortf. In the initial let*,
the arguments and their subforms are carefully evaluated in
left-to-right order. Then appear three expressions which compare and
possibly swap the values of the temporary variables: the first is
compared to the second, then the first to the third, then the second to
the third. Finally the the generalized variables are reassigned
left-to-right. Although the issue rarely arises, macro arguments should
usually be assigned left-to-right, as well as being evaluated in this
order.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (sortf > x (aref ar (incf i)) (car lst))
#+END_EXAMPLE

expands (in one possible implementation) into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let* ((#:g1 x)
           (#:g4 ar)
           (#:g3 (incf i))
           (#:g2 (aref #:g4 #:g3))
           (#:g6 lst)
           (#:g5 (car #:g6)))
      (unless (> #:g1 #:g2)
        (rotatef #:g1 #:g2))
      (unless (> #:g1 #:g5)
        (rotatef #:g1 #:g5))
      (unless (> #:g2 #:g5)
        (rotatef #:g2 #:g5))
      (setq x #:g1)
      (system:set-aref #:g2 #:g4 #:g3)
      (system:set-car #:g6 #:g5))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 12.5: Expansion of a call to sortf.

<<IDX64>>

Operators like f and sortf bear a certain resemblance to functions that
take functional arguments. It should be understood that they are
something quite different. A function like find-if takes a function and
calls it; a macro like f takes a name, and makes it the car of an
expression. Both f and sortf could have been written to take functional
arguments. For example, f could have been written:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro _f (op place &rest args)
      (let ((g (gensym)))
        (multiple-value-bind (vars forms var set access)
        (get-setf-method place)
          `(let* ((,g ,op)
              ,@(mapcar #'list vars forms)
              (,(car var) (funcall ,g ,access ,@args)))
         ,set))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and called ( f #'+ x 1). But the original version of f can do anything
this one could, and since it deals in names, it can also take the name
of a macro or special form. As well as +, you could call, for example,
nif (page 150):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((x 2))
    (_f nif x 'p 'z 'n)
    x)
    P
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<Defining Inversions>><<SEC94>>

** 12.5 Defining Inversions
Section 12.1 explained that any macro call which expands into an
invertible reference will itself be invertible. You don't have to define
operators as macros just to make them invertible, though. By using
defsetf you can tell Lisp how to invert any function or macro call.

This macro can be used in two ways. In the simplest case, its arguments
are two symbols:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defsetf symbol-value set)
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the more complicated form, a call to defsetf is like a call to
defmacro, with an additional parameter for the updated value form. For
example, this would define a possible inversion for car:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defsetf car (lst) (new-car)
      `(progn (rplaca ,lst ,new-car)
          ,new-car))
#+END_EXAMPLE

There is one important difference between defmacro and defsetf: the
latter automatically creates gensyms for its arguments. With the
definition given above, (setf (car x) y) would expand into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let* ((#:g2 x)
           (#:g1 y))
      (progn (rplaca #:g2 #:g1)
         #:g1))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defvar *cache* (make-hash-table))

    (defun retrieve (key)
      (multiple-value-bind (x y) (gethash key *cache*)
        (if y
        (values x y)
          (cdr (assoc key *world*)))))

    (defsetf retrieve (key) (val)
      `(setf (gethash ,key *cache*) ,val))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 12.6: An asymmetric inversion.

<<IDX65>>

Thus we can write defsetf expanders without having to worry about
variable capture, or number or order of evaluations.

In CLTL2 Common Lisp, it is possible to define setf inversions directly
with defun, so the previous example could also be written:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun (setf car) (new-car lst)
      (rplaca lst new-car)
      new-car)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The updated value should be the first parameter in such a function. It
is also conventional to return this value as the value of the function.

The examples so far have suggested that generalized variables are
supposed to refer to a place in a data structure. The villain carries
his hostage down to the dungeon, and the rescuing hero carries her back
up again; they both follow the same path, but in different directions.
It's not surprising if people have the impression that setf must work
this way, because all the predefined inversions seem to be of this form;
indeed, place is the conventional name for a parameter which is to be
inverted.

In principle, setf is more general: an access form and its inversion
need not even operate on the same data structure. Suppose that in some
application we want to cache database updates. This could be necessary,
for example, if it were not efficient to do real updates on the fly, or
if all the updates had to be verified for consistency before committing
to them.

Suppose that *world* is the actual database. For simplicity, we will
make it an assoc-list whose elements are of the form (key . val). Figure
12.6 shows a lookup function called retrieve. If *world* is

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ((a . 2) (b . 16) (c . 50) (d . 20) (f . 12))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (retrieve 'c)
    50
#+END_EXAMPLE

Unlike a call to car, a call to retrieve does not refer to a specific
place in a data structure. The return value could come from one of two
places. And the inversion of retrieve, also defined in Figure 12.6, only
refers to one of them:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setf (retrieve 'n) 77)
    77
    > (retrieve 'n)
    77
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

This lookup returns a second value of t, indicating that the answer was
found in the cache.

Like macros themselves, generalized variables are an abstraction of
remarkable power. There is probably more to be discovered here.
Certainly individual users are likely to discover ways in which the use
of generalized variables could lead to more elegant or more powerful
programs. But it may also be possible to use setf inversion in new ways,
or to discover other classes of similarly useful transformations.

* 13. Computation at Compile-Time
The preceding chapters described several types of operators which have
to be implemented by macros. This one describes a class of problems
which could be solved by functions, but where macros are more efficient.
Section 8.2 listed the pros and cons of using macros in a given
situation. Among the pros was "computation at compile-time." By defining
an operator as a macro, you can sometimes make it do some of its work
when it is expanded. This chapter looks at macros which take advantage
of this possibility.

** 13.1 New Utilities
Section 8.2 raised the possibility of using macros to shift computation
to compile-time. There we had as an example the macro avg, which returns
the average of its arguments:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (avg pi 4 5)
    4.047...
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 13.1 shows avg defined first as a function and then as a macro.
When avg is defined as a macro, the call to length can be made at
compile-time. In the macro version we also avoid the expense of
manipulating the &rest parameter at runtime. In many implementations,
avg will be faster written as a macro.

The kind of savings which comes from knowing the number of arguments at
expansion-time can be combined with the kind we get from in (page 152),
where it was possible to avoid even evaluating some of the arguments.
Figure 13.2 contains two versions of most-of, which returns true if most
of its arguments do:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (most-of t t t nil)
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun avg (&rest args)
      (/ (apply #'+ args) (length args)))

    (defmacro avg (&rest args)
      `(/ (+ ,@args) ,(length args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 13.1: Shifting computation when finding averages.

<<IDX66>>

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun most-of (&rest args)
      (let ((all 0)
        (hits 0))
        (dolist (a args)
          (incf all)
          (if a (incf hits)))
        (> hits (/ all 2))))

    (defmacro most-of (&rest args)
      (let ((need (floor (/ (length args) 2)))
        (hits (gensym)))
        `(let ((,hits 0))
           (or ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (a)
                  `(and ,a (> (incf ,hits) ,need)))
                  args)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 13.2: Shifting and avoiding computation.

<<IDX67>>

The macro version expands into code which, like in, only evaluates as
many of the arguments as it needs to. For example, (most-of (a) (b) (c))
expands into the equivalent of:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((count 0))
      (or (and (a) (> (incf count) 1))
          (and (b) (> (incf count) 1))
          (and (c) (> (incf count) 1))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the best case, just over half the arguments will be evaluated.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun nthmost (n lst)
      (nth n (sort (copy-list lst) #'>)))

    (defmacro nthmost (n lst)
      (if (and (integerp n) (< n 20))
          (with-gensyms (glst gi)
                (let ((syms (map0-n #'(lambda (x) (gensym)) n)))
                  `(let ((,glst ,lst))
                 (unless (< (length ,glst) ,(1+ n))
                   ,@(gen-start glst syms)
                   (dolist (,gi ,glst)
                     ,(nthmost-gen gi syms t))
                   ,(car (last syms))))))
        `(nth ,n (sort (copy-list ,lst) #'>))))

    (defun gen-start (glst syms)
      (reverse
       (maplist #'(lambda (syms)
            (let ((var (gensym)))
              `(let ((,var (pop ,glst)))
                 ,(nthmost-gen var (reverse syms)))))
            (reverse syms))))

    (defun nthmost-gen (var vars &optional long?)
      (if (null vars)
          nil
        (let ((else (nthmost-gen var (cdr vars) long?)))
          (if (and (not long?) (null else))
          `(setq ,(car vars) ,var)
        `(if (> ,var ,(car vars))
             (setq ,@(mapcan #'list
                      (reverse vars)
                      (cdr (reverse vars)))
               ,(car vars) ,var)
           ,else)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 13.3: Use of arguments known at compile-time.

<<IDX68>>

A macro may also be able to shift computation to compile-time if the
values of particular arguments are known. Figure 13.3 contains an
example of such a macro. The function nthmost takes a number n and a
list of numbers, and returns the nth largest among them; like other
sequence functions, it is zero-indexed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (nthmost 2 '(2 6 1 5 3 4))
    4
#+END_EXAMPLE

The function version is written very simply. It sorts the list and calls
nth on the result. Since sort is destructive, nthmost copies the list
before sorting it. Written thus, nthmost is inefficient is two respects:
it conses, and it sorts the entire list of arguments, though all we care
about are the top n.

If we know n at compile-time, we can approach the problem differently.
The rest of the code in Figure 13.3 defines a macro version of nthmost.
The first thing this macro does is look at its first argument. If the
first argument is not a literal number, it expands into the same code we
saw above. If the first argument is a number, we can follow a different
course. If you wanted to find, say, the third biggest cookie on a plate,
you could do it by looking at each cookie in turn, always keeping in
your hand the three biggest found so far. When you have looked at all
the cookies, the smallest cookie in your hand is the one you are looking
for. If n is a small constant, not proportional to the number of
cookies, then this technique gets you a given cookie with less effort
that it would take to sort all of them first.

This is the strategy followed when n is known at expansion-time. In its
expansion, the macro creates n variables, then calls nthmost-gen to
generate the code which has to be evaluated upon looking at each cookie.
Figure 13.4 shows a sample macroexpansion. The macro nthmost behaves
just like the original function, except that it can't be passed as an
argument to apply. The justification for using a macro is purely one of
efficiency: the macro version does not cons at runtime, and if n is a
small constant, performs fewer comparisons.

To have efficient programs, must one then take the trouble to write such
huge macros? In this case, probably not. The two versions of nthmost are
intended as an example of a general principle: when some arguments are
known at compile-time, you can use a macro to generate more efficient
code. Whether or not you take advantage of this possibility will depend
on how much you stand to gain, and how much more effort it will take to
write an efficient macro version. Since the macro version of nthmost is
long and complicated, it would only be worth writing in extreme cases.
However, information known at compile-time is always a factor worth
considering, even if you choose not to take advantage of it.

<<Bezier Curves Example>><<SEC97>>

** 13.2 Bezier Curves Example
Like the with- macro (Section 11.2), the macro for computation at
compile-time is more likely to be written for a specific application
than as a general-purpose utility. How much can a general-purpose
utility know at compile-time? The number of arguments it has been given,
and perhaps some of their values. If we want to use other constraints,
they will probably have to be ones imposed by individual programs.

As an example, this section shows how macros can speed up the generation
of Bezier curves. Curves must be generated fast if they are being
manipulated interactively. It turns out that if the number of segments
in the curve is known beforehand, most of the computation can be done at
compile-time. By writing our curve-generator as a macro, we can weave
precomputed values right into code. This should be even faster than the
more usual optimization of storing them in an array.

A Bezier curve is defined in terms of four points--two endpoints and two
control points. When we are working in two dimensions, these points
define parametric equations for the x and y coordinates of points on the
curve. If the two endpoints are (x 0 , y 0 ) and (x 3 , y 3 ) and the
two control points are (x 1 , y 1 ) and (x 2 , y 2 ), then the equations
defining points on the curve are:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    x = (x 3 - 3x 2 + 3x 1 - x 0 )u 3 + (3x 2 - 6x 1 + 3x 0 )u 2 +
        (3x 1 - 3x 0 )u + x 0

    y = (y 3 - 3y 2 + 3y 1 - y 0 )u 3 + (3y 2 - 6y 1 + 3y 0 )u 2 +
        (3y 1 - 3y 0 )u + y 0
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we evaluate these equations for n values of u between 0 and 1, we get
n points on the curve. For example, if we want to draw the curve as 20
segments, then we would evaluate the equations for u = .05, .1,. . .,
.95. There is no need to evaluate them for u of 0 or 1, because if u = 0
they will yield the first endpoint (x 0 , y 0 ), and if u = 1 they will
yield the second endpoint (x 3 , y 3 ).

An obvious optimization is to make n fixed, calculate the powers of u
beforehand, and store them in an (n-1) × 3 array. By defining the
curve-generator as a macro, we can do even better. If n is known at
expansion-time, the program could simply expand into n line-drawing
commands. The precomputed powers of u, instead of being stored in an
array, could be inserted as literal values right into the macro
expansion.

Figure 13.5 contains a curve-generatingmacro which implements this
strategy. Instead of drawing lines immediately, it dumps the generated
points into an array. When a curve is moving interactively, each
instance has to be drawn twice: once to show it, and again to erase it
before drawing the next. In the meantime, the points have to be saved
somewhere.

With n = 20, genbez expands into 21 setfs. Since the powers of u appear
directly in the code, we save the cost of looking them up at runtime,
and the cost of computing them at startup. Like the powers of u, the
array indices appear as constants in the expansion, so the
bounds-checking for the (setf aref)s could also be done at compile-time.

<<Applications>><<SEC98>>

** 13.3 Applications
Later chapters contain several other macros which use information
available at compile-time. A good example is if-match (page 242).
Pattern-matchers compare two sequences, possibly containing variables,
to see if there is some way of assigning values to the variables which
will make the two sequences equal. The design of if-match shows that if
one of the sequences is known at compile-time, and only that one
contains variables, then matching can be done more efficiently. Instead
of comparing the two sequences at runtime and consing up lists to hold
the variable bindings established in the process, we can have a macro
generate code to perform the exact comparisons dictated by the known
sequence, and can store the bindings in real Lisp variables.

The embedded languages described in Chapters 19--24 also, for the most
part, take advantage of information available at compile-time. Since an
embedded language is a compiler of sorts, it's only natural that it
should use such information. As a general rule, the more elaborate the
macro, the more constraints it imposes on its arguments, and the better
your chances of using these constraints to generate efficient code.

* 14. Anaphoric Macros
Chapter 9 treated variable capture exclusively as a problem--as
something which happens inadvertently, and which can only affect
programs for the worse. This chapter will show that variable capture can
also be used constructively. There are some useful macros which couldn't
be written without it.

It's not uncommon in a Lisp program to want to test whether an
expression returns a non-nil value, and if so, to do something with the
value. If the expression is costly to evaluate, then one must normally
do something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((result (big-long-calculation)))
      (if result
          (foo result)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Wouldn't it be easier if we could just say, as we would in English:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (if (big-long-calculation)
        (foo it))
#+END_EXAMPLE

By taking advantage of variable capture, we can write a version of if
which works just this way.

** 14.1 Anaphoric Variants
In natural language, an anaphor is an expression which refers back in
the conversation. The most common anaphor in English is probably "it,"
as in "Get the wrench and put it on the table." Anaphora are a great
convenience in everyday language--imagine trying to get along without
them--but they don't appear much in programming languages. For the most
part, this is good. Anaphoric expressions are often genuinely ambiguous,
and present-day programming languages are not designed to handle
ambiguity.

However, it is possible to introduce a very limited form of anaphora
into Lisp programs without causing ambiguity. An anaphor, it turns out,
is a lot like a captured symbol. We can use anaphora in programs by
designating certain symbols to serve as pronouns, and then writing
macros intentionally to capture these symbols.

In the new version of if, the symbol it is the one we want to capture.
The anaphoric if, called aif for short, is defined as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro aif (test-form then-form &optional else-form)
      `(let ((it ,test-form))
         (if it ,then-form ,else-form)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and used as in the previous example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (aif (big-long-calculation)
         (foo it))
#+END_EXAMPLE

When you use an aif, the symbol it is left bound to the result returned
by the test clause. In the macro call, it seems to be free, but in fact
the expression (foo it) will be inserted by expansion of the aif into a
context in which the symbol it is bound:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((it (big-long-calculation)))
      (if it (foo it) nil))
#+END_EXAMPLE

So a symbol which looks free in the source code is left bound by the
macroexpansion. All the anaphoric macros in this chapter use some
variation of the same technique.

Figure 14.1 contains anaphoric variants of several Common Lisp
operators. After aif comes awhen, the obvious anaphoric variant of when:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (awhen (big-long-calculation)
           (foo it)
           (bar it))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Both aif and awhen are frequently useful, but awhile is probably unique
among the anaphoric macros in being more often needed than its regular
cousin, while (defined on page 91). Macros like while and awhile are
typically used in situations where a program needs to poll some outside
source. And when you are polling a source, unless you are simply waiting
for it to change state, you will usually want to do something with the
object you find there:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (awhile (poll *fridge*)
        (eat it))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro aif (test-form then-form &optional else-form)
      `(let ((it ,test-form))
         (if it ,then-form ,else-form)))

    (defmacro awhen (test-form &body body)
      `(aif ,test-form
        (progn ,@body)))

    (defmacro awhile (expr &body body)
      `(do ((it ,expr ,expr))
           ((not it))
         ,@body))

    (defmacro aand (&rest args)
      (cond ((null args) t)
        ((null (cdr args)) (car args))
        (t `(aif ,(car args) (aand ,@(cdr args))))))

    (defmacro acond (&rest clauses)
      (if (null clauses)
          nil
        (let ((cl1 (car clauses))
          (sym (gensym)))
          `(let ((,sym ,(car cl1)))
         (if ,sym
             (let ((it ,sym)) ,@(cdr cl1))
           (acond ,@(cdr clauses)))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 14.1: Anaphoric variants of Common Lisp operators.

<<IDX71>><<IDX72>>

The definition of aand is a bit more complicated than the preceding
ones. It provides an anaphoric version of and; during the evaluation of
each of its arguments, it will be bound to the value returned by the
previous argument.[fn:30] In practice, aand tends to be
used in programs which make conditional queries, as in:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (aand (owner x) (address it) (town it))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which returns the town (if there is one) of the address (if there is
one) of the owner (if there is one) of x. Without aand, this expression
would have to be written

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((own (owner x)))
      (if own
          (let ((adr (address own)))
        (if adr (town adr)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The definition of aand shows that the expansion will vary depending on
the number of arguments in the macro call. If there are no arguments,
then aand, like the regular and, should simply return t. Otherwise the
expansion is generated recursively, each step yielding one layer in a
chain of nested aifs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (aif #first argument#
         #expansion for rest of arguments#)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The expansion of an aand must terminate when there is one argument left,
instead of working its way down to nil like most recursive functions. If
the recursion continued until no conjuncts remained, the expansion would
always be of the form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (aif #c 1 #
         . . .
         (aif #c n #
          t). . .)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Such an expression would always return t or nil, and the example above
wouldn't work as intended.

Section 10.4 warned that if a macro always yielded an expansion
containing a call to itself, the expansion would never terminate. Though
recursive, aand is safe because in the base case its expansion doesn't
refer to aand.

The last example, acond, is meant for those cases where the remainder of
a cond clause wants to use the value returned by the test expression.
(This situation arises so often that some Scheme implementations provide
a way to use the value returned by the test expression in a cond
clause.)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro alambda (parms &body body)
      `(labels ((self ,parms ,@body))
         #'self))

    (defmacro ablock (tag &rest args)
      `(block ,tag
         ,(funcall (alambda (args)
                (case (length args)
                  (0 nil)
                  (1 (car args))
                  (t `(let ((it ,(car args)))
                    ,(self (cdr args))))))
               args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 14.2: More anaphoric variants.

<<IDX73>>

In the expansion of an acond clause, the result of the test expression
will initially be kept in a gensymed variable, in order that the symbol
it may be bound only within the remainder of the clause. When macros
create bindings, they should always do so over the narrowest possible
scope. Here, if we dispensed with the gensym and instead bound it
immediately to the result of the test expression, as in:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro acond (&rest clauses)     ; wrong
      (if (null clauses)
          nil
        (let ((cl1 (car clauses)))
          `(let ((it ,(car cl1)))
         (if it
             (progn ,@(cdr cl1))
           (acond ,@(cdr clauses)))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then that binding of it would also have within its scope the following
test expression.

Figure 14.2 contains some more complicated anaphoric variants. The macro
alambda is for referring literally to recursive functions. When does one
want to refer literally to a recursive function? We can refer literally
to a function by using a sharp-quoted lambda-expression:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #'
    (lambda (x) (* x 2))
#+END_EXAMPLE

But as Chapter 2 explained, you can't express a recursive function with
a simple lambda-expression. Instead you have to define a local function
with labels. The following function (reproduced from page 22)

<<IDX74>>

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun count-instances (obj lists)
      (labels ((instances-in (list)
                 (if list
                     (+ (if (eq (car list) obj) 1 0)
                    (instances-in (cdr list)))
                   0)))
        (mapcar #'instances-in lists)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

takes an object and a list, and returns a list of the number of
occurrences of the object in each element:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (count-instances 'a '((a b c) (d a r p a) (d a r) (a a)))
    (1 2 1 2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

With anaphora we can make what amounts to a literal recursive function.
The alambda macro uses labels to create one, and thus can be used to
express, for example, the factorial function:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (alambda (x) (if (= x 0) 1 (* x (self (1- x)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Using alambda we can define an equivalent version of count-instances as
follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun count-instances (obj lists)
      (mapcar (alambda (list)
               (if list
                   (+ (if (eq (car list) obj) 1 0)
                  (self (cdr list)))
                 0))
          lists))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Unlike the other macros in Figures 14.1 and 14.2, which all capture it,
alambda captures self. An instance of alambda expands into a labels
expression in which self is bound to the function being defined. As well
as being smaller, alambda expressions look like familiar lambda
expressions, making code which uses them easier to read.

The new macro is used in the definition of ablock, an anaphoric version
of the built-in block special form. In a block, the arguments are
evaluated left-to-right. The same happens in an ablock, but within each
the variable it will be bound to the value of the previous expression.

This macro should be used with discretion. Though convenient at times,
ablock would tend to beat what could be nice functional programs into
imperative form. The following is, unfortunately, a characteristically
ugly example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (ablock north-pole
    (princ "ho ")
    (princ it)
    (princ it)
    (return-from north-pole))
    ho ho ho
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Whenever a macro which does intentional variable capture is exported to
another package, it is necessary also to export the symbol being
captured. For example, wherever aif is exported, it should be as well.
Otherwise the it which appears in the macro definition would be a
different symbol from an it used in a macro call.

<<Failure>><<SEC101>>

** 14.2 Failure
In Common Lisp the symbol nil has at least three different jobs. It is
first of all the empty list, so that

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (cdr '(a))
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

As well as the empty list, nil is used to represent falsity, as in

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (= 1 0)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

And finally, functions return nil to indicate failure. For example, the
job of the built-in find-if is to return the first element of a list
which satisfies some test. If no such element is found, find-if returns
nil:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (find-if #'oddp '(2 4 6))
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Unfortunately, we can't tell this case from the one in which find-if
succeeds, but succeeds in finding nil:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (find-if #'null '(2 nil 6))
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

In practice, it doesn't cause too much trouble to use nil to represent
both falsity and the empty list. In fact, it can be rather convenient.
However, it is a pain to have nil represent failure as well, because it
means that the result returned by a function like find-if can be
ambiguous.

The problem of distinguishing between failure and a nil return value
arises with any function which looks things up. Common Lisp offers no
less than three solutions to the problem. The most common approach,
before multiple return values, was to return gratuitous list structure.
There is no trouble distinguishing failure with assoc, for example; when
successful it returns the whole pair in question:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq synonyms '((yes . t) (no . nil)))
    ((YES . T) (NO))
    > (assoc 'no synonyms)
    (NO)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Following this approach, if we were worried about ambiguity with
find-if, we would use member-if, which instead of just returning the
element satisfying the test, returns the whole cdr which begins with it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (member-if #'null '(2 nil 6))
    (NIL 6)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Since the advent of multiple return values, there has been another
solution to this problem: use one value for data and a second to
indicate success or failure. The built-in gethash works this way. It
always returns two values, the second indicating whether anything was
found:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setf edible (make-hash-table)
    (gethash 'olive-oil edible) t
    (gethash 'motor-oil edible) nil)
    NIL
    > (gethash 'motor-oil edible)
    NIL
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

So if you want to detect all three possible cases, you can use an idiom
like the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun edible? (x)
      (multiple-value-bind (val found?) (gethash x edible)
        (if found?
        (if val 'yes 'no)
          'maybe)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

thereby distinguishing falsity from failure:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapcar #'edible? '(motor-oil olive-oil iguana))
    (NO YES MAYBE)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Common Lisp supports yet a third way of indicating failure: to have the
access function take as an argument a special object, presumably a
gensym, to be returned in case of failure. This approach is used with
get, which takes an optional argument saying what to return if the
specified property isn't found:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (get 'life 'meaning (gensym))
    #:G618
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where multiple return values are possible, the approach used by gethash
is the cleanest. We don't want to have to pass additional arguments to
every access function, as we do with get. And between the other two
alternatives, using multiple values is the more general; find-ifcould be
written to return two values, but gethash could not, without consing, be
written to return disambiguating list structure. Thus in writing new
functions for lookup, or for other tasks where failure is possible, it
will usually be better to follow the model of gethash.

The idiom found in edible? is just the sort of bookkeeping which is well
hidden by a macro. For access functions like gethashwe will want a new
version of aif which, instead of binding and testing the same value,
binds the first but also tests the second. The new version of aif,
called aif2, is shown in Figure 14.3. Using it we could write edible?
as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun edible? (x)
      (aif2 (gethash x edible)
        (if it 'yes 'no)
        'maybe))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 14.3 also contains similarly altered versions of awhen, awhile,
and acond. For an example of the use of acond2, see the definition of
match on page 239. By using this macro we are able to express in the
form of a cond a function that would otherwise be much longer and less
symmetrical.

The built-in read indicates failure in the same way as get. It takes
optional arguments saying whether or not to generate an error in case of
eof, and if not, what value to return. Figure 14.4 contains an
alternative version of read which uses a second return value to indicate
failure: read2 returns two values, the input expression and a flag which
is nil upon eof. It calls read with a gensym to be returned in case of
eof, but to save the trouble of building the gensym each time read2 is
called, the function is defined as a closure with a private copy of a
gensym made at compile time.

Figure 14.4 also contains a convenient macro to iterate over the
expressions in a file, written using awhile2 and read2. Using do-file we
could, for example, write a version of load as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-load (filename)
      (do-file filename (eval it)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro aif2 (test &optional then else)
      (let ((win (gensym)))
        `(multiple-value-bind (it ,win) ,test
           (if (or it ,win) ,then ,else))))

    (defmacro awhen2 (test &body body)
      `(aif2 ,test
         (progn ,@body)))

    (defmacro awhile2 (test &body body)
      (let ((flag (gensym)))
        `(let ((,flag t))
           (while ,flag
         (aif2 ,test
               (progn ,@body)
               (setq ,flag nil))))))

    (defmacro acond2 (&rest clauses)
      (if (null clauses)
          nil
        (let ((cl1 (car clauses))
          (val (gensym))
          (win (gensym)))
          `(multiple-value-bind (,val ,win) ,(car cl1)
         (if (or ,val ,win)
             (let ((it ,val)) ,@(cdr cl1))
           (acond2 ,@(cdr clauses)))))))

<<Referential Transparency>><<SEC102>>

** 14.3 Referential Transparency
Anaphoric macros are sometimes said to violate referential transparency,
which Gelernter and Jagannathan define as follows: A language is
referentially transparent if (a) every subexpression can be replaced by
any other that's equal to it in value and (b) all occurrences of an
expression within a given context yield the same value.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((g (gensym)))
      (defun read2 (&optional (str *standard-input*))
        (let ((val (read str nil g)))
          (unless (equal val g) (values val t)))))

    (defmacro do-file (filename &body body)
      (let ((str (gensym)))
        `(with-open-file (,str ,filename)
                 (awhile2 (read2 ,str)
                      ,@body))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 14.4: File utilities.

<<IDX76>>

Note that this standard applies to languages,not to programs. No
language with assignment is referentially transparent. The first and the
last x in this expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (list x
          (setq x (not x))
          x)
#+END_EXAMPLE

yield different values, because a setq intervenes. Admittedly, this is
ugly code. The fact that it is even possible means that Lisp is not
referentially transparent.

Norvig mentions that it would be convenient to redefine if as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro if (test then &optional else)
      `(let ((that ,test))
         (if that ,then ,else)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

but rejects this macro on the grounds that it violates referential
transparency.

However, the problem here comes from redefining built-in operators, not
from using anaphora. Clause (b) of the definition above requires that an
expression always return the same value "within a given context." It is
no problem if, within this let expression,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((that 'which))
      ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

the symbol that denotes a new variable, because let is advertised to
create a new context.

The trouble with the macro above is that it redefines if, which is not
supposed to create a new context. This problem goes away if we give
anaphoric macros distinct names. (As of CLTL2, it is illegal to redefine
if anyway.) As long as it is part of the definition of aif that it
establishes a new context in which it is a new variable, such a macro
does not violate referential transparency.

Now, aif does violate another convention, which has nothing to do with
referential transparency: that newly established variables somehow be
indicated in the source code. The let expression above clearly indicates
that that will refer to a new variable. It could be argued that the
binding of it within an aif is not so clear. However, this is not a very
strong argument: aif only creates one variable, and the creation of that
variable is the only reason to use it.

Common Lisp itself does not treat this convention as inviolable. The
binding of the CLOS function call-next-method depends on the context in
just the same way that the binding of the symbol it does within the body
of an aif. (For a suggestion of how call-next-method would be
implemented, see the macro defmeth on page 358.) In any case, such
conventions are only supposed to be a means to an end: programs which
are easy to read. And anaphora do make programs easier to read, just as
they make English easier to read.

* 15. Macros Returning Functions
Chapter 5 showed how to write functions which return other functions.
Macros make the task of combining operators much easier. This chapter
will show how to use macros to build abstractions which are equivalent
to those defined in Chapter 5, but cleaner and more efficient.

** 15.1 Building Functions
If f and g are functions, then f #g(x) = f (g(x)). Section 5.4 showed
how to implement the # operator as a Lisp function called compose:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (funcall (compose #'list #'1+) 2)
    (3)
#+END_EXAMPLE

In this section, we consider ways to define better function builders
with macros. Figure 15.1 contains a general function-builder called fn,
which builds compound functions from their descriptions. Its argument
should be an expression of the form (operator . arguments). The operator
can be the name of a function or macro--or compose, which is treated
specially. The arguments can be names of functions or macros of one
argument, or expressions that could be arguments to fn. For example,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (fn (and integerp oddp))
#+END_EXAMPLE

yields a function equivalent to

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #'
    (lambda (x) (and (integerp x) (oddp x)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro fn (expr) `#',(rbuild expr))

    (defun rbuild (expr)
      (if (or (atom expr) (eq (car expr) 'lambda))
          expr
        (if (eq (car expr) 'compose)
        (build-compose (cdr expr))
          (build-call (car expr) (cdr expr)))))

    (defun build-call (op fns)
      (let ((g (gensym)))
        `(lambda (,g)
           (,op ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (f)
                   `(,(rbuild f) ,g))
                   fns)))))

    (defun build-compose (fns)
      (let ((g (gensym)))
        `(lambda (,g)
           ,(labels ((rec (fns)
                  (if fns
                  `(,(rbuild (car fns))
                    ,(rec (cdr fns)))
                g)))
          (rec fns)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 15.1: General function-building macro.

<<IDX77>>

If we use compose as the operator, we get a function representing the
composition of the arguments, but without the explicit funcalls that
were needed when compose was defined as a function. For example,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (fn (compose list 1+ truncate))
#+END_EXAMPLE

expands into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #'
    (lambda (#:g1) (list (1+ (truncate #:g1))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which enables inline compilation of simple functions like list and 1+.
The fn macro takes names of operators in the general sense;
lambda-expressions are allowed too, as in

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (fn (compose (lambda (x) (+ x 3)) truncate))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which expands into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #'
    (lambda (#:g2) ((lambda (x) (+ x 3)) (truncate #:g2)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here the function expressed as a lambda-expression will certainly be
compiled inline, whereas a sharp-quoted lambda-expression given as an
argument to the function compose would have to be funcalled.

Section 5.4 showed how to define three more function builders: fif,
fint, and fun. These are now subsumed in the general fn macro. Using and
as the operator yields the intersection of the operators given as
arguments:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapcar (fn (and integerp oddp))
    '(c 3 p 0))
    (NIL T NIL NIL)
#+END_EXAMPLE

while or yields the union:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapcar (fn (or integerp symbolp))
    '(c 3 p 0.2))
    (T T T NIL)
#+END_EXAMPLE

and if yields a function whose body is a conditional:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (map1-n (fn (if oddp 1+ identity)) 6)
    (2 2 4 4 6 6)
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, we can use other Lisp functions besides these three:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapcar (fn (list 1- identity 1+))
    '(1 2 3))
    ((0 1 2) (1 2 3) (2 3 4))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and the arguments in the fn expression may themselves be expressions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (remove-if (fn (or (and integerp oddp)
    (and consp cdr)))
    '(1 (a b) c (d) 2 3.4 (e f g)))
    (C (D) 2 3.4)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Making fn treat compose as a special case does not make it any more
powerful. If you nest the arguments to fn, you get functional
composition. For example,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (fn (list (1+ truncate)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

expands into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #'
    (lambda (#:g1)
        (list ((lambda (#:g2) (1+ (truncate #:g2))) #:g1)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which behaves like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (compose #'list #'1+ #'truncate)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The fn macro treats compose as a special case only to make such calls
easier to read.

<<Recursion on Cdrs (Macros Returning Functions)>><<SEC105>>

** 15.2 Recursion on Cdrs
Sections 5.5 and 5.6 showed how to write functions that build recursive
functions. The following two sections show how anaphoric macros can
provide a cleaner interface to the functions we defined there.

Section 5.5 showed how to define a flat list recurser builder called
lrec. With lrec we can express a call to:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-every (fn lst)
      (if (null lst)
          t
        (and (funcall fn (car lst))
         (our-every fn (cdr lst)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

for e.g. oddp as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (lrec #'(lambda (x f) (and (oddp x) (funcall f)))
          t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here macros could make life easier. How much do we really have to say to
express recursive functions? If we can refer anaphorically to the
current car of the list (as it) and the recursive call (as rec), we
should be able to make do with something like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (alrec (and (oddp it) rec) t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 15.2 contains the definition of the macro which will allow us to
say this.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (funcall (alrec (and (oddp it) rec) t)
    '(1 3 5))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro alrec (rec &optional base)
      "cltl2 version"
      (let ((gfn (gensym)))
        `(lrec #'(lambda (it ,gfn)
               (symbol-macrolet ((rec (funcall ,gfn)))
             ,rec))
           ,base)))

    (defmacro alrec (rec &optional base)
      "cltl1 version"
      (let ((gfn (gensym)))
        `(lrec #'(lambda (it ,gfn)
               (labels ((rec () (funcall ,gfn)))
             ,rec))
           ,base)))

    (defmacro on-cdrs (rec base &rest lsts)
      `(funcall (alrec ,rec #'(lambda () ,base)) ,@lsts))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 15.2: Macros for list recursion.

<<IDX78>>

The new macro works by transforming the expression given as the second
argument into a function to be passed to lrec. Since the second argument
may refer anaphorically to it or rec, in the macro expansion the body of
the function must appear within the scope of bindings established for
these symbols.

Figure 15.2 actually has two different versions of alrec. The version
used in the preceding examples requires symbol macros (Section 7.11).
Only recent versions of Common Lisp have symbol macros, so Figure 15.2
also contains a slightly less convenient version of alrec in which rec
is defined as a local function. The price is that, as a function, rec
would have to be enclosed within parentheses:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (alrec (and (oddp it) (rec)) t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The original version is preferable in Common Lisp implementations which
provide symbol-macrolet.

Common Lisp, with its separate name-space for functions, makes it
awkward to use these recursion builders to define named functions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (symbol-function 'our-length)
          (alrec (1+ rec) 0))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-copy-list (lst)
      (on-cdrs (cons it rec) nil lst))

    (defun our-remove-duplicates (lst)
      (on-cdrs (adjoin it rec) nil lst))

    (defun our-find-if (fn lst)
      (on-cdrs (if (funcall fn it) it rec) nil lst))

    (defun our-some (fn lst)
      (on-cdrs (or (funcall fn it) rec) nil lst))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 15.3: Common Lisp functions defined with on-cdrs.

<<IDX79>>

The final macro in Figure 15.2 is intended to make this more abstract.
Using on-cdrs we could say instead:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-length (lst)
      (on-cdrs (1+ rec) 0 lst))

    (defun our-every (fn lst)
      (on-cdrs (and (funcall fn it) rec) t lst))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 15.3 shows some existing Common Lisp functions defined with the
new macro. Expressed with on-cdrs, these functions are reduced to their
most basic form, and we notice similarities between them which might not
otherwise have been apparent.

Figure 15.4 contains some new utilities which can easily be defined with
on-cdrs. The first three, unions, intersections, and differences
implement set union, intersection, and complement, respectively. Common
Lisp has built-in functions for these operations, but they can only take
two lists at a time. Thus if we want to find the union of three lists we
have to say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (union '(a b) (union '(b c) '(c d)))
    (A B C D)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The new unions behaves like union, but takes an arbitrary number of
arguments, so that we could say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (unions '(a b) '(b c) '(c d))
    (D C A B)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun unions (&rest sets)
      (on-cdrs (union it rec) (car sets) (cdr sets)))

    (defun intersections (&rest sets)
      (unless (some #'null sets)
        (on-cdrs (intersection it rec) (car sets) (cdr sets))))

    (defun differences (set &rest outs)
      (on-cdrs (set-difference rec it) set outs))

    (defun maxmin (args)
      (when args
        (on-cdrs (multiple-value-bind (mx mn) rec
               (values (max mx it) (min mn it)))
             (values (car args) (car args))
             (cdr args))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 15.4: New utilities defined with on-cdrs.

<<IDX80>>

Like union, unions does not preserve the order of the elements in the
initial lists.

The same relation holds between the Common Lisp intersection and the
more general intersections. In the definition of this function, the
initial test for null arguments was added for efficiency; it
short-circuits the computation if one of the sets is empty.

Common Lisp also has a function called set-difference, which takes two
lists and returns the elements of the first which are not in the second:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (set-difference '(a b c d) '(a c))
    (D B)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Our new version handles multiple arguments much as - does. For example,
(differences x y z) is equivalent to (set-difference x (unions y z)),
though without the consing that the latter would entail.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (differences '(a b c d e) '(a f) '(d))
    (B C E)
#+END_EXAMPLE

These set operators are intended only as examples. There is no real need
for them, because they represent a degenerate case of list recursion
already handled by the built-in reduce. For example, instead of

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (unions ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

you might as well say just

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ((lambda (&rest args) (reduce #'union args)) ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the general case, on-cdrs is more powerful than reduce, however.

Because rec refers to a call instead of a value, we can use on-cdrs to
create functions which return multiple values. The final function in
Figure 15.4, maxmin, takes advantage of this possibility to find both
the maximum and minimum elements in a single traversal of a list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (maxmin '(3 4 2 8 5 1 6 7))
    8
    1
#+END_EXAMPLE

It would also have been possible to use on-cdrs in some of the code
which appears in later chapters. For example, compile-cmds (page 310)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun compile-cmds (cmds)
      (if (null cmds)
          'regs
        `(,@(car cmds) ,(compile-cmds (cdr cmds)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

could have been defined as simply:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun compile-cmds (cmds)
      (on-cdrs `(,@it ,rec) 'regs cmds))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<Recursion on Subtrees (Macros Returning Functions)>><<SEC106>>

** 15.3 Recursion on Subtrees
What macros did for recursion on lists, they can also do for recursion
on trees. In this section, we use macros to define cleaner interfaces to
the tree recursers defined in Section 5.6.

In Section 5.6 we defined two tree recursion builders, ttrav,which
always traverses the whole tree, and trec which is more complex, but
allows you to control when recursion stops. Using these functions we
could express our-copy-tree

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun our-copy-tree (tree)
      (if (atom tree)
          tree
        (cons (our-copy-tree (car tree))
          (if (cdr tree) (our-copy-tree (cdr tree))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

as

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (ttrav #'cons)
#+END_EXAMPLE

and a call to rfind-if

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun rfind-if (fn tree)
      (if (atom tree)
          (and (funcall fn tree) tree)
        (or (rfind-if fn (car tree))
        (and (cdr tree) (rfind-if fn (cdr tree))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

for e.g. oddp as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (trec #'(lambda (o l r) (or (funcall l) (funcall r)))
          #'(lambda (tree) (and (oddp tree) tree)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Anaphoric macros can make a better interface to trec, as they did for
lrec in the previous section. A macro sufficient for the general case
will have to be able to refer anaphorically to three things: the current
tree, which we'll call it, the recursion down the left subtree, which
we'll call left, and the recursion down the right subtree, which we'll
call right. With these conventions established, we should be able to
express the preceding functions in terms of a new macro thus:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (atrec (cons left right))

    (atrec (or left right) (and (oddp it) it))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 15.5 contains the definition of this macro.

In versions of Lisp which don't have symbol-macrolet,we can define atrec
using the second definition in Figure 15.5. This version defines left
and right as local functions, so our-copy-tree would have to be
expressed as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (atrec (cons (left) (right)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

For convenience, we also define a macro on-trees, which is analogous to
on-cdrs from the previous section. Figure 15.6 shows the four functions
from Section 5.6 defined with on-trees.

As noted in Chapter 5, functions built by the recurser generators
defined in that chapter will not be tail-recursive. Using on-cdrs or
on-trees to define a function will not necessarily yield the most
efficient implementation. Like the underlying trec and lrec, these
macros are mainly for use in prototypes and in parts of a program where
efficiency is not paramount. However, the underlying idea of this
chapter and Chapter 5 is that one can write function generators and put
a clean macro interface on them. This same technique could equally well
be used to build function generators which yielded particularly
efficient code.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro atrec (rec &optional (base 'it))
      "cltl2 version"
      (let ((lfn (gensym)) (rfn (gensym)))
        `(trec #'(lambda (it ,lfn ,rfn)
               (symbol-macrolet ((left (funcall ,lfn))
                     (right (funcall ,rfn)))
             ,rec))
           #'(lambda (it) ,base))))

    (defmacro atrec (rec &optional (base 'it))
      "cltl1 version"
      (let ((lfn (gensym)) (rfn (gensym)))
        `(trec #'(lambda (it ,lfn ,rfn)
               (labels ((left () (funcall ,lfn))
                (right () (funcall ,rfn)))
             ,rec))

<<Lazy Evaluation>><<SEC107>>

** 15.4 Lazy Evaluation
Lazy evaluation means only evaluating an expression when you need its
value. One way to use lazy evaluation is to build an object known as a
delay. A delay is a placeholder for the value of some expression. It
represents a promise to deliver the value of the expression if it is
needed at some later time. Meanwhile, since the promise is a Lisp
object, it can serve many of the purposes of the value it represents.
And when the value of the expression is needed, the delay can return it.

Scheme has built-in support for delays. The Scheme operators force and
delay can be implemented in Common Lisp as in Figure 15.7. A delay is
represented as a two-part structure. The first field indicates whether
the delay has been evaluated yet, and if it has, contains the value. The
second field contains a closure which can be called to find the value
that the delay represents. The macro delay takes an expression, and
returns a delay representing its value:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((x 2))
    (setq d (delay (1+ x))))
    #S(DELAY ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

To call the closure within a delay is to force the delay. The function
force takes any object: for ordinary objects it is the identity
function, but for delays it is a demand for the value that the delay
represents.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (force 'a)
    A
    > (force d)
    3
#+END_EXAMPLE

We use force whenever we are dealing with objects that might be delays.
For example, if we are sorting a list which might contain delays, we
would say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (sort lst #'(lambda (x y) (> (force x) (force y))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

It's slightly inconvenient to use delays in this naked form. In a real
application, they might be hidden beneath another layer of abstraction.

* 16. Macro-Defining Macros
Patterns in code often signal the need for new abstractions. This rule
holds just as much for the code in macros themselves. When several
macros have definitions of a similar form, we may be able to write a
macro-defining macro to produce them. This chapter presents three
examples of macro-defining macros: one to define abbreviations, one to
define access macros, and a third to define anaphoric macros of the type
described in Section 14.1.

** 16.1 Abbreviations
The simplest use of macros is as abbreviations. Some Common Lisp
operators have rather long names. Ranking high among them (though by no
means the longest) is destructuring-bind, which has 18 characters. A
corollary of Steele's principle (page 43) is that commonly used
operators ought to have short names. ("We think of addition as cheap
partly because we can notate it with a single character: `+'.") The
built-in destructuring-bind macro introduces a new layer of abstraction,
but the actual gain in brevity is masked by its long name:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((a (car x)) (b (cdr x))) ...)

    (destructuring-bind (a . b) x ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

A program, like printed text, is easiest to read when it contains no
more than about 70 characters per line. We begin at a disadvantage when
the lengths of individual names are a quarter of that.

<<IDX84>>

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro abbrev (short long)
      `(defmacro ,short (&rest args)
         `(,',long ,@args)))

    (defmacro abbrevs (&rest names)
      `(progn
         ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (pair)
                `(abbrev ,@pair))
            (group names 2))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 16.1: Automatic definition of abbreviations.

<<IDX85>><<IDX86>><<IDX87>>

Fortunately, in a language like Lisp you don't have to live with all the
decisions of the designers. Having defined

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro dbind (&rest args)
      `(destructuring-bind ,@args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

you need never use the long name again. Likewise for
multiple-value-bind, which is longer and more frequently used.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro mvbind (&rest args)
      `(multiple-value-bind ,@args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notice how nearly identical are the definitions of dbind and mvbind.
Indeed, this formula of &rest and comma-at will suffice to define an
abbreviation for any function,[fn:31] macro, or special
form. Why crank out more definitions on the model of mvbind when we
could have a macro do it for us?

To define a macro-defining macro we will often need nested backquotes.
Nested backquotes are notoriously hard to understand. Eventually common
cases will become familiar, but one should not expect to be able to look
at an arbitrary backquoted expression and say what it will yield. It is
not a fault in Lisp that this is so, any more than it is a fault of the
notation that one can't just look at a complicated integral and know
what its value will be. The difficulty is in the problem, not the
notation.

However, as we do when finding integrals, we can break up the analysis
of backquotes into small steps, each of which can easily be followed.
Suppose we want to write a macro abbrev, which will allow us to define
mvbind just by saying

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (abbrev mvbind multiple-value-bind)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 16.1 contains a definition of this macro. Where did it come from?
The definition of such a macro can be derived from a sample expansion.
One expansion is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro mvbind (&rest args)
      `(multiple-value-bind ,@args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The derivation will be easier if we pull multiple-value-bind from within
the backquote, because we know it will be an argument to the eventual
macro. This yields the equivalent definition

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro mvbind (&rest args)
      (let ((name 'multiple-value-bind))
        `(,name ,@args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now we take this expression and turn it into a template. We affix a
backquote, and replace the expressions which will vary, with variables.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    `(defmacro ,short (&rest args)
       (let ((name ',long))
         `(,name ,@args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The final step is to simplify this expression by substituting ',long for
name within the inner backquote:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    `(defmacro ,short (&rest args)
       `(,',long ,@args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which yields the body of the macro defined in Figure 16.1.

Figure 16.1 also contains abbrevs, for cases where we want to define
several abbreviations in one shot.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (abbrevs dbind destructuring-bind
         mvbind multiple-value-bind
         mvsetq multiple-value-setq)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The user of abbrevs doesn't have to insert additional parentheses
because abbrevs calls group (page 47) to group its arguments by twos.
It's generally a good thing for macros to save users from typing
logically unnecessary parentheses, and group will be useful to most such
macros.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro propmacro (propname)
      `(defmacro ,propname (obj)
         `(get ,obj ',',propname)))

    (defmacro propmacros (&rest props)
      `(progn
         ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (p) `(propmacro ,p))
            props)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 16.2: Automatic definition of access macros.

<<Properties>><<SEC110>>

** 16.2 Properties
Lisp offers manyways to associate properties with objects. If the object
in question can be represented as a symbol, one of the most convenient
(though least efficient) ways is to use the symbol's property list. To
describe the fact that an object o has a property p, the value of which
is v, we modify the property list of o:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (get o p) v)
#+END_EXAMPLE

So to say that ball1 has color red, we say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (get 'ball1 'color) 'red)
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we're going to refer often to some property of objects, we can define
a macro to retrieve it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro color (obj)
      `(get ,obj 'color))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and thereafter use color in place of get:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (color 'ball1)
    RED
#+END_EXAMPLE

Since macro calls are transparent to setf (see Chapter 12) we can also
say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setf (color 'ball1) 'green)
    GREEN
#+END_EXAMPLE

Such macros have the advantage of hiding the particular way in which the
program represents the color of an object. Property lists are slow; a
later version of the program might, for the sake of speed, represent
color as a field in a structure, or an entry in a hash-table. When data
is reached through a facade of macros like color, it becomes easy, even
in a comparatively mature program, to make pervasive changes to the
lowest-level code. If a program switches from using property lists to
structures, nothing above the facade of access macros will have to be
changed; none of the code which looks upon the facade need even be aware
of the rebuilding going on behind it.

For the weight property, we can define a macro similar to the one
written for color:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro weight (obj)
      `(get ,obj 'weight))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Like the abbreviations in the previous section, the definitions of of
color and weight are nearly identical. Here propmacro (Figure 16.2) can
play the same role as abbrev did.

A macro-defining macro can be designed by the same process as any other
macro: look at the macro call, then its intended expansion, then figure
out how to transform the former into the latter. We want

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (propmacro color)
#+END_EXAMPLE

to expand into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro color (obj)
      `(get ,obj 'color))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Though this expression is itself a defmacro, we can still make a
template of it, by backquoting it and putting comma'd parameter names in
place of instances of color. As in the previous section, we begin by
transforming it so that no instances of color are within existing
backquotes:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro color (obj)
      (let ((p 'color))
        `(get ,obj ',p)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then we go ahead and make the template,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    `(defmacro ,propname (obj)
       (let ((p ',propname))
         `(get ,obj ',p)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which simplifies to

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    `(defmacro ,propname (obj)
       `(get ,obj ',',propname))
#+END_EXAMPLE

For cases where a group of property-names all have to be defined as
macros, there is propmacros (Figure 16.2), which expands into a series
of individual calls to propmacro. Like abbrevs, this modest piece of
code is actually a macro-defining-macro-defining macro.

Though this section dealt with property lists, the technique described
here is a general one. We could use it to define access macros on data
stored in any form.

<<Anaphoric Macros (Macro-Defining Macros)>><<SEC111>>

** 16.3 Anaphoric Macros
Section 14.1 gave definitions of several anaphoric macros. When you use
a macro like aif or aand, during the evaluation of some arguments the
symbol it will be bound to the values returned by other ones. So instead
of

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((res (complicated-query)))
      (if res
          (foo res)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

you can use just

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (aif (complicated-query)
         (foo it))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and instead of

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((o (owner x)))
      (and o (let ((a (address o)))
           (and a (city a)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

simply

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (aand (owner x) (address it) (city it))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Section 14.1 presented seven anaphoric macros: aif, awhen, awhile,
acond, alambda, ablock, and aand. These seven are by no means the only
useful anaphoric macros of their type. In fact, we can define an
anaphoric variant of just about any Common Lisp function or macro. Many
of these macros will be like mapcon: rarely used, but indispensable when
they are needed.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro a+ (&rest args)
      (a+expand args nil))

    (defun a+expand (args syms)
      (if args
          (let ((sym (gensym)))
        `(let* ((,sym ,(car args))
            (it ,sym))
           ,(a+expand (cdr args)
                  (append syms (list sym)))))
        `(+ ,@syms)))

    (defmacro alist (&rest args)
      (alist-expand args nil))

    (defun alist-expand (args syms)
      (if args
          (let ((sym (gensym)))
        `(let* ((,sym ,(car args))
            (it ,sym))
           ,(alist-expand (cdr args)
                  (append syms (list sym)))))
        `(list ,@syms)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 16.3: Definitions of a+ and alist.

<<IDX89>>

For example, we can define a+ so that, as with aand, it is always bound
to the value returned by the previous argument. The following function
calculates the cost of dining out in Massachusetts:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun mass-cost (menu-price)
      (a+ menu-price (* it .05) (* it 3)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The Massachusetts Meals Tax is 5%, and residents often calculate the tip
by tripling the tax. By this formula, the total cost of the broiled
scrod at Dolphin Seafood is therefore:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mass-cost 7.95)
    9.54
#+END_EXAMPLE

but this includes salad and a baked potato.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro defanaph (name &optional calls)
      (let ((calls (or calls (pop-symbol name))))
        `(defmacro ,name (&rest args)
           (anaphex args (list ',calls)))))

    (defun anaphex (args expr)
      (if args
          (let ((sym (gensym)))
        `(let* ((,sym ,(car args))
            (it ,sym))
           ,(anaphex (cdr args)
                 (append expr (list sym)))))
        expr))

    (defun pop-symbol (sym)
      (intern (subseq (symbol-name sym) 1)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 16.4: Automatic definition of anaphoric macros.

<<IDX90>>

The macro a+,defined in Figure 16.3,relies on a recursive
function,a+expand, to generate its expansion. The general strategy of
a+expand is to cdr down the list of arguments in the macro call,
generating a series of nested let expressions; each let leaves it bound
to a different argument, but also binds a distinct gensym to each
argument. The expansion function accumulates a list of these gensyms,
and when it reaches the end of the list of arguments it returns a +
expression with the gensyms as the arguments. So the expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (a+ menu-price (* it .05) (* it 3))
#+END_EXAMPLE

yields the macroexpansion:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let* ((#:g2 menu-price) (it #:g2))
      (let* ((#:g3 (* it 0.05)) (it #:g3))
        (let* ((#:g4 (* it 3)) (it #:g4))
          (+ #:g2 #:g3 #:g4))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 16.3 also contains the definition of the analogous alist.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (alist 1 (+ 2 it) (+ 2 it))
    (1 3 5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once again, the definitions of a+ and alist are almost identical. If we
want to define more macros like them, these too will be mostly duplicate
code. Why not have a program produce it for us? The macro defanaph in
Figure 16.4 will do so. With defanaph, defining a+ and alist is as
simple as

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defanaph a+)

    (defanaph alist)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The expansions of a+ and alist so defined will be identical to the
expansions made by the code in Figure 16.3. The macro-defining macro
defanaph will create an anaphoric variant of anything whose arguments
are evaluated according to the normal evaluation rule for functions.
That is, defanaph will work for anything whose arguments are all
evaluated, and evaluated left-to-right. So you couldn't use this version
of defanaph to define aif or awhile, but you can use it to define an
anaphoric variant of any function.

As a+ called a+expand to generate its expansion, defanaph defines a
macro which will call anaphex to do so. The generic expander anaphex
differs from a+expand only in taking as an argument the function name to
appear finally in the expansion. In fact, a+ could now be defined:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro a+ (&rest args)
      (anaphex args '(+)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Neither anaphex nor a+expand need have been defined as distinct
functions: anaphex could have been defined with labels or alambda within
defanaph. The expansion generators are here broken out as separate
functions only for the sake of clarity.

By default, defanaph determines what to call in the expansion by pulling
the first letter (presumably an a) from the front of its argument. (This
operation is performed by pop-symbol.) If the user prefers to specify an
alternate name, it can be given as an optional argument. Although
defanaph can build anaphoric variants of all functions and some macros,
it imposes some irksome restrictions:

1. It only works for operators whose arguments are all evaluated.
2. In the macroexpansion, it is always bound to successive arguments. In
   some cases--awhen, for example--we want it to stay bound to the value
   of the first argument.
3. It won't work for a macro like setf, which expects a generalized
   variable as its first argument.

Let's consider how to remove some of these restrictions. Part of the
first problem can be solved by solving the second. To generate
expansions for a macro like aif, we need a modified version of anaphex
which only replaces the first argument in the macro call:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun anaphex2 (op args)
      `(let ((it ,(car args)))
         (,op it ,@(cdr args))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This nonrecursive version of anaphex doesn't need to ensure that the
macroexpansion will bind it to successive arguments, so it can generate
an expansion which won't necessarily evaluate all the arguments in the
macro call. Only the first argument must be evaluated, in order to bind
it to its value. So aif could be defined as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro aif (&rest args)
      (anaphex2 'if args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This definition would differ from the original on page 191 only in the
point where it would complain if aif were given the wrong number of
arguments; for correct macro calls, the two generate identical
expansions.

The third problem, that defanaph won't work with generalized variables,
can be solved by using f (page 173) in the expansion. Operators like
setf can be handled by a variant of anaphex2 defined as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun anaphex3 (op args)
      `(_f (lambda (it) (,op it ,@(cdr args))) ,(car args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This expander assumes that the macro call will have one or more
arguments, the first of which will be a generalized variable. Using it
we could define asetf thus:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro asetf (&rest args)
      (anaphex3 'setf args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 16.5 shows all three expander functions yoked together under the
control of a single macro, the new defanaph. The user signals the type
of macro expansion desired with the optional rule keyword parameter,
which specifies the evaluation rule to be used for the arguments in the
macro call. If this parameter is:

- =:all= :: (the default) the macroexpansion will be on the model of
  alist. All the arguments in the macro call will be evaluated, with it
  always bound to the value of the previous argument.
- =:first= :: the macroexpansion will be on the model of aif. Only the
  first argument will necessarily be evaluated, and it will be bound to
  its value.
- =:place= :: the macroexpansion will be on the model of asetf. The
  first argument will be treated as a generalized variable, and it will
  be bound to its initial value.

Using the new defanaph, some of the previous examples would be defined
as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defanaph alist)

    (defanaph aif :rule :first)

    (defanaph asetf :rule :place)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro defanaph (name &optional &key calls (rule :all))
      (let* ((opname (or calls (pop-symbol name)))
         (body (case rule
             (:all `(anaphex1 args '(,opname)))
             (:first `(anaphex2 ',opname args))
             (:place `(anaphex3 ',opname args)))))
        `(defmacro ,name (&rest args)
           ,body)))

    (defun anaphex1 (args call)
      (if args
          (let ((sym (gensym)))
        `(let* ((,sym ,(car args))
            (it ,sym))
           ,(anaphex1 (cdr args)
                  (append call (list sym)))))
        call))

    (defun anaphex2 (op args)
      `(let ((it ,(car args))) (,op it ,@(cdr args))))

    (defun anaphex3 (op args)
      `(_f (lambda (it) (,op it ,@(cdr args))) ,(car args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 16.5: More general defanaph.

<<IDX91>>

One of the advantages of asetf is that it makes it possible to define a
large class of macros on generalized variables without worrying about
multiple evaluation. For example, we could define incf as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro incf (place &optional (val 1))
      `(asetf ,place (+ it ,val)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and, say, pull (page 173) as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro pull (obj place &rest args)
      `(asetf ,place (delete ,obj it ,@args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

* 17. Read-Macros
The three big moments in a Lisp expression's life are read-time,
compile-time, and runtime. Functions are in control at runtime. Macros
give us a chance to perform transformations on programs at compile-time.
This chapter discusses read-macros, which do their work at read-time.

** 17.1 Macro Characters
In keeping with the general philosophy of Lisp, you have a great deal of
control over the reader. Its behavior is controlled by properties and
variables that can all be changed on the fly. The reader can be
programmed at several levels. The easiest way to change its behavior is
by defining new macro characters.

A macro character is a character which exacts special treatment from the
Lisp reader. A lower-case a, for example, is ordinarily handled just
like a lower-case b, but a left parenthesis is something different: it
tells Lisp to begin reading a list. Each such character has a function
associated with it that tells the Lisp reader what to do when the
character is encountered. You can change the function associated with an
existing macro character, or define new macro characters of your own.

The built-in function set-macro-character provides one way to define
read-macros. It takes a character and a function, and thereafter when
read encounters the character, it returns the result of calling the
function.

One of the oldest read-macros in Lisp is ', the quote. You could do
without ' by always writing (quote a) instead of 'a, but this would be
tiresome and would make your code harder to read. The quote read-macro
makes it possible to use 'a as an abbreviation for (quote a). We could
define it as in Figure 17.1.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (set-macro-character #\'
                 #'(lambda (stream char)
                 (list 'quote (read stream t nil t))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 17.1: Possible definition of '.

When read encounters an instance of ' in a normal context (e.g. not in
"a'b" or |a'b|), it will return the result of calling this function on
the current stream and character. (The function ignores this second
parameter, which will always be the quote character.) So when read sees
'a, it will return (quote a).

The last three arguments to read control respectively whether
encountering an end-of-file should cause an error, what value to return
otherwise, and whether the call to read occurs within a call to read. In
nearly all read-macros, the second and fourth arguments should be t, and
the third argument is therefore irrelevant.

Read-macros and ordinary macros are both functions underneath. And like
the functions that generate macro expansions, the functions associated
with macro characters shouldn't have side-effects, except on the stream
from which they read. Common Lisp explicitly makes no guarantees about
when, or how often, the function associated with a read-macro will be
called. (See CLTL2, p. 543.)

Macros and read-macros see your program at different stages. Macros get
hold of the program when it has already been parsed into Lisp objects by
the reader, and read-macros operate on a program while it is still text.
However, by invoking read on this text, a read-macro can, if it chooses,
get parsed Lisp objects as well. Thus read-macros are at least as
powerful as ordinary macros.

Indeed, read-macros are more powerful in at least two ways. A read-macro
affects everything read by Lisp, while a macro will only be expanded in
code. And since read-macros generally call read recursively, an
expression like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ''a
#+END_EXAMPLE

becomes

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (quote (quote a))
#+END_EXAMPLE

whereas if we had tried to define an abbreviation for quote using a
normal macro,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro q (obj)
      `(quote ,obj))
#+END_EXAMPLE

it would work in isolation,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (eq 'a (q a))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

but not when nested. For example,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (q (q a))
#+END_EXAMPLE

would expand into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (quote (q a))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (set-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\?
                      #'(lambda (stream char1 char2)
                      `#'(lambda (&rest ,(gensym))
                           ,(read stream t nil t))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<Dispatching Macro Characters>><<SEC114>>

** 17.2 Dispatching Macro Characters
The sharp-quote, like other read-macros beginning with #, is an example
of a subspecies called dispatching read-macros. These appear as two
characters, the first of which is called the dispatching character. The
purpose of such read-macros is simply to make the most of the ASCII
character set; one can only have so many one-character read-macros.

You can (with make-dispatch-macro-character) define your own dispatching
macro characters, but since # is already defined as one, you may as well
use it. Some combinations beginning with # are explicitly reserved for
your use; others are available in that they do not yet have a predefined
meaning in Common Lisp. The complete list appears in CLTL2, p. 531.

New dispatching macro character combinations can be defined by calling
the function set-dispatch-macro-character, like set-macro-character
except that it takes two character arguments. One of the combinations
reserved to the programmer is #?. Figure 17.2 shows how to define this
combination as a read-macro for constant functions. Now #?2 will be read
as a function which takes any number of arguments and returns 2. For
example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapcar #?2 '(a b c))
    (2 2 2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (set-macro-character #\] (get-macro-character #\)))
    (set-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\[
                      #'(lambda (stream char1 char2)
                      (let ((accum nil)
                        (pair (read-delimited-list #\] stream t)))
                        (do ((i (ceiling (car pair)) (1+ i)))
                        ((> i (floor (cadr pair)))
                         (list 'quote (nreverse accum)))
                          (push i accum)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<IDX94>>

This example makes the new operator look rather pointless, but in
programs that use a lot of functional arguments, constant functions are
often needed. In fact, some dialects provide a built-in function called
always for defining them.

Note that it is perfectly ok to use macro characters in the definition
of this macro character: as with any Lisp expression, they disappear
when the definition is read. It is also fine to use macro-characters
after the #?. The definition of #? calls read, so macro-characters like
' and #' behave as usual:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (eq (funcall #?'a) 'a)
    T
    > (eq (funcall #?#'oddp) (symbol-function 'oddp))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<Delimiters>><<SEC115>>

** 17.3 Delimiters
After simple macro characters, the most commonly defined macro
characters are list delimiters. Another character combination reserved
for the user is #[. Figure 17.3 gives an example of how this character
might be defined as a more elaborate kind of left parenthesis. It
defines an expression of the form #[x y] to read as a list of all the
integers between x and y, inclusive:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > #[2 7]
    (2 3 4 5 6 7)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The only new thing about this read-macro is the call to
read-delimited-list, a built-in function provided just for such cases.
Its first argument is the character to treat as the end of the list. For
] to be recognized as a delimiter, it must first be given this role,
hence the preliminary call to set-macro-character.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro defdelim (left right parms &body body)
      `(ddfn ,left ,right #'(lambda ,parms ,@body)))

    (let ((rpar (get-macro-character #\) )))
      (defun ddfn (left right fn)
        (set-macro-character right rpar)
        (set-dispatch-macro-character #\# left
                      #'(lambda (stream char1 char2)
                          (apply fn
                             (read-delimited-list right stream t))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 17.4: A macro for defining delimiter read-macros.

<<IDX95>>

Most potential delimiter read-macro definitions will duplicate a lot of
the code in Figure 17.3. A macro could put a more abstract interface on
all this machinery. Figure 17.4 shows how we might define a utility for
defining delimiter read-macros. The defdelim macro takes two characters,
a parameter list, and a body of code. The parameter list and the body of
code implicitly define a function. A call to defdelim defines the first
character as a dispatching read-macro which reads up to the second, then
returns the result of applying this function to what it read.

Incidentally, the body of the function in Figure 17.3 also cries out for
a utility--- for one we have already defined, in fact: mapa-b, from page
54. Using defdelim and mapa-b, the read-macro defined in Figure 17.3
could now be written:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defdelim #\[ #\] (x y)
      (list 'quote (mapa-b #'identity (ceiling x) (floor y))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Another useful delimiter read-macro would be one for functional
composition. Section 5.4 defined an operator for functional composition:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((f1 (compose #'list #'1+))
    (f2 #'(lambda (x) (list (1+ x)))))
    (equal (funcall f1 7) (funcall f2 7)))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defdelim #\{ #\} (&rest args)
      `(fn (compose ,@args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 17.5: A read-macro for functional composition.

<<IDX96>>

When we are composing built-in functions like list and 1+, there is no
reason to wait until runtime to evaluate the call to compose. Section
5.7 suggested an alternative; by prefixing the sharp-dot read-macro to a
compose expression,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #.(compose #'list #'1+)
#+END_EXAMPLE

we could cause it to be evaluated at read-time.

Here we show a similar but cleaner solution. The read-macro in Figure
17.5 defines an expression of the form #{f 1 f 2 . . . f n } to read as
the composition of f 1 , f 2 , . . . , f n . Thus:

@example > (funcall #{list 1+} 7) (8) @end example

It works by generating a call to fn (page 202), which will create the
function at compile-time.

<<When What Happens>><<SEC116>>

** 17.4 When What Happens
Finally, it might be useful to clear up a possibly confusing issue. If
read-macros are invoked before ordinary macros, how is it that macros
can expand into expressions which contain read-macros? For example, the
macro:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro quotable ()
      '(list 'able))
#+END_EXAMPLE

generates an expansion with a quote in it. Or does it? In fact, what
happens is that both quotes in the definition of this macro are expanded
when the defmacro expression is read, yielding

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro quotable ()
      (quote (list (quote able))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Usually, there is no harm in acting as if macroexpansions could contain
read-macros, because the definition of a read-macro will not (or should
not) change between read-time and compile-time.

* 18. Destructuring
Destructuring is a generalization of assignment. The operators setq and
setf do assignments to individual variables. Destructuring combines
assignment with access: instead of giving a single variable as the first
argument, we give a pattern of variables, which are each assigned the
value occurring in the corresponding position in some structure.

** 18.1 Destructuring on Lists
As of CLTL2, Common Lisp includes a new macro called destructuring-bind.
This macro was briefly introduced in Chapter 7. Here we consider it in
more detail. Suppose that lst is a list of three elements, and we want
to bind x to the first, y to the second, and z to the third. In raw
CLTL1 Common Lisp, we would have had to say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x (first lst))
          (y (second lst))
          (z (third lst)))
      ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

With the new macro we can say instead

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (destructuring-bind (x y z) lst
      ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

which is not only shorter, but clearer as well. Readers grasp visual
cues much faster than textual ones. In the latter form we are shown the
relationship between x, y, and z; in the former, we have to infer it.

If such a simple case is made clearer by the use of destructuring,
imagine the improvement in more complex ones. The first argument to
destructuring-bind can be an arbitrarily complex tree. Imagine

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (destructuring-bind ((first last) (month day year) . notes)
        birthday
      ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

written using let and the list access functions. Which raises another
point: destructuring makes it easier to write programs as well as easier
to read them.

Destructuring did exist in CLTL1 Common Lisp. If the patterns in the
examples above look familiar, it's because they have the same form as
macro parameter lists. In fact, destructuring-bind is the code used to
take apart macro argument lists, now sold separately. You can put
anything in the pattern that you would put in a macro parameter list,
with one unimportant exception (the &environment keyword).

Establishing bindings en masse is an attractive idea. The following
sections describe several variations upon this theme.

** 18.2 Other Structures
There is no reason to limit destructuring to lists. Any complex object
is a candidate for it. This section shows how to write macros like
destructuring-bind for other kinds of objects.

The natural next step is to handle sequences generally. Figure 18.1
contains a macro called dbind, which resembles destructuring-bind, but
works for any kind of sequence. The second argument can be a list, a
vector, or any combination thereof:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (dbind (a b c) #(1 2 3)
    (list a b c))
    (1 2 3)
    > (dbind (a (b c) d) '( 1 #(2 3) 4)
    (list a b c d))
    (1 2 3 4)
    > (dbind (a (b . c) &rest d) '(1 "fribble" 2 3 4)
    (list a b c d))
    (1 #\f "ribble" (2 3 4))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro dbind (pat seq &body body)
      (let ((gseq (gensym)))
        `(let ((,gseq ,seq))
           ,(dbind-ex (destruc pat gseq #'atom) body))))

    (defun destruc (pat seq &optional (atom? #'atom) (n 0))
      (if (null pat)
          nil
        (let ((rest (cond ((funcall atom? pat) pat)
                  ((eq (car pat) '&rest) (cadr pat))
                  ((eq (car pat) '&body) (cadr pat))
                  (t nil))))
          (if rest
          `((,rest (subseq ,seq ,n)))
        (let ((p (car pat))
              (rec (destruc (cdr pat) seq atom? (1+ n))))
          (if (funcall atom? p)
              (cons `(,p (elt ,seq ,n))
                rec)
            (let ((var (gensym)))
              (cons (cons `(,var (elt ,seq ,n))
                  (destruc p var atom?))
                rec))))))))

    (defun dbind-ex (binds body)
      (if (null binds)
          `(progn ,@body)
        `(let ,(mapcar #'(lambda (b)
                   (if (consp (car b))
                   (car b)
                 b))
               binds)
           ,(dbind-ex (mapcan #'(lambda (b)
                      (if (consp (car b))
                      (cdr b)))
                  binds)
              body))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 18.1: General sequence destructuring operator.

The #( read-macro is for representing vectors, and #\ for representing
characters. Since "abc" = #(#\a #\b #\c), the first element of "fribble"
is the character #\f. For the sake of simplicity, dbind supports only
the &rest and &body keywords.

Compared to most of the macros seen so far, dbind is big. It's worth
studying the implementation of this macro, not only to understand how it
works, but also because it embodies a general lesson about Lisp
programming. As section 3.4 mentioned, Lisp programs may intentionally
be written in a way that will make them easy to test. In most code, we
have to balance this desire against the need for speed. Fortunately, as
Section 7.8 explained, speed is not so important in expander code. When
writing code that generates macroexpansions, we can make life easier for
ourselves. The expansion of dbind is generated by two functions, destruc
and dbind-ex. Perhaps they both could be combined into one function
which would do everything in a single pass. But why bother? As two
separate functions, they will be easier to test. Why trade this
advantage for speed we don't need?

The first function, destruc, traverses the pattern and associates each
variable with the location of the corresponding object at runtime:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (destruc '(a b c) 'seq #'atom)
    ((A (ELT SEQ 0)) (B (ELT SEQ 1)) (C (ELT SEQ 2)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The optional third argument is the predicate used to distinguish pattern
structure from pattern content.

To make access more efficient, a new variable (a gensym) will be bound
to each subsequence:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (destruc '(a (b . c) &rest d) 'seq)
    ((A (ELT SEQ 0))
    ((#:G2 (ELT SEQ 1)) (B (ELT #:G2 0)) (C (SUBSEQ #:G2 1)))
    (D (SUBSEQ SEQ 2)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The output of destruc is sent to dbind-ex, which generates the bulk of
the macroexpansion. It translates the tree produced by destruc into a
nested series of lets:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (dbind-ex (destruc '(a (b . c) &rest d) 'seq) '(body))
    (LET ((A (ELT SEQ 0))
    (#:G4 (ELT SEQ 1))
    (D (SUBSEQ SEQ 2)))
    (LET ((B (ELT #:G4 0))
    (C (SUBSEQ #:G4 1)))
    (PROGN BODY)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-matrix (pats ar &body body)
      (let ((gar (gensym)))
        `(let ((,gar ,ar))
           (let ,(let ((row -1))
               (mapcan
            #'(lambda (pat)
                (incf row)
                (setq col -1)
                (mapcar #'(lambda (p)
                    `(,p (aref ,gar
                           ,row
                           ,(incf col))))
                    pat))
            pats))
         ,@body))))

    (defmacro with-array (pat ar &body body)
      (let ((gar (gensym)))
        `(let ((,gar ,ar))
           (let ,(mapcar #'(lambda (p)
                 `(,(car p) (aref ,gar ,@(cdr p))))
                 pat)
         ,@body))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 18.2: Destructuring on arrays.

Note that dbind, like destructuring-bind, assumes that it will find all
the list structure it is looking for. Left-over variables are not simply
bound to nil, as with multiple-value-bind. If the sequence given at
runtime does not have all the expected elements, destructuring operators
generate an error: > (dbind (a b c) (list 1 2)) >>Error: 2 is not a
valid index for the sequence (1 2)

What other objects have internal structure? There are arrays generally,
which differ from vectors in having more than one dimension. If we
define a destructuring macro for arrays, how do we represent the
pattern? For two-dimensional arrays, it is still practical to use a
list. Figure 18.2 contains a macro, with-matrix, for destructuring on
two-dimensional arrays.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-struct ((name . fields) struct &body body)
      (let ((gs (gensym)))
        `(let ((,gs ,struct))
           (let ,(mapcar #'(lambda (f)
                 `(,f (,(symb name f) ,gs)))
                 fields)
         ,@body))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 18.3: Destructuring on structures.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq ar (make-array '(3 3)))
    #<Simple-Array T (3 3) C2D39E>
    > (for (r 0 2)
    (for (c 0 2)
    (setf (aref ar r c) (+ (* r 10) c))))
    NIL
    > (with-matrix ((a b c)
    (d e f)
    (g h i)) ar
    (list a b c d e f g h i))
    (0 1 2 10 11 12 20 21 22)
#+END_EXAMPLE

For large arrays or those with dimension 3 or higher, we want a
different kind of approach. We are not likely to want to bind variables
to each element of a large array. It will be more practical to make the
pattern a sparse representation of the array--containing variables for
only a few elements, plus coordinates to identify them. The second macro
in Figure 18.2 is built on this principle. Here we use it to get the
diagonal of our previous array:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-array ((a 0 0) (d 1 1) (i 2 2)) ar
    (values a d i))
    0
    11
    22
#+END_EXAMPLE

With this new macro we have begun to move away from patterns whose
elements must occur in a fixed order. We can make a similar sort of
macro to bind variables to fields in structures built by defstruct. Such
a macro is defined in Figure 18.3. The first argument in the pattern is
taken to be the prefix associated with the structure, and the rest are
field names. To build access calls, this macro uses symb (page 58).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (defstruct visitor name title firm)
    VISITOR
    > (setq theo (make-visitor :name "Theodebert"
    :title 'king
    :firm 'franks))
    #S(VISITOR NAME "Theodebert" TITLE KING FIRM FRANKS)
    > (with-struct (visitor- name firm title) theo
    (list name firm title))
    ("Theodebert" FRANKS KING)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** 18.3 Reference
CLOS brings with it a macro for destructuring on instances. Suppose tree
is a class with three slots, species, age, and height, and that my-tree
is an instance of tree. Within

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (with-slots (species age height) my-tree
            ...)
#+END_EXAMPLE

we can refer to the slots of my-tree as if they were ordinary variables.
Within the body of the with-slots, the symbol height refers to the
height slot. It is not simply bound to the value stored there, but
refers to the slot, so that if we write:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq height 72)
#+END_EXAMPLE

then the height slot of my-tree will be given the value 72. This macro
works by defining height as a symbol-macro (Section 7.11) which expands
into a slot reference. In fact, it was to support macros like with-slots
that symbol-macrolet was added to Common Lisp.

Whether or not with-slots is really a destructuring macro, it has the
same role pragmatically as destructuring-bind. As conventional
destructuring is to call-by-value, this new kind is to call-by-name.
Whatever we call it, it looks to be useful. What other macros can we
define on the same principle?

We can create a call-by-name version of any destructuring macro by
making it expand into a symbol-macrolet rather than a let. Figure 18.4
shows a version of dbind modified to behave like with-slots. We can use
with-places as we do dbind:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-places (a b c) #(1 2 3)
    (list a b c))
    (1 2 3)
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-places (pat seq &body body)
      (let ((gseq (gensym)))
        `(let ((,gseq ,seq))
           ,(wplac-ex (destruc pat gseq #'atom) body))))

    (defun wplac-ex (binds body)
      (if (null binds)
          `(progn ,@body)
        `(symbol-macrolet ,(mapcar #'(lambda (b)
                       (if (consp (car b))
                           (car b)
                         b))
                       binds)
           ,(wplac-ex (mapcan #'(lambda (b)
                      (if (consp (car b))
                      (cdr b)))
                  binds)
              body))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 18.4: Reference destructuring on sequences.

But the new macro also gives us the option to setf positions in
sequences, as we do slots in with-slots:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((lst '(1 (2 3) 4)))
    (with-places (a (b . c) d) lst
    (setf a 'uno)
    (setf c '(tre)))
    lst)
    (UNO (2 TRE) 4)
#+END_EXAMPLE

As in a with-slots, the variables now refer to the corresponding
locations in the structure. There is one important difference, however:
you must use setf rather than setq to set these pseudo-variables. The
with-slots macro must invoke a code-walker (page 273) to transform setqs
into setfs within its body. Here, writing a code-walker would be a lot
of code for a small refinement.

If with-places is more general than dbind, why not just use it all the
time?

While dbind associates a variable with a value, with-places associates
it with a set of instructions for finding a value. Every reference
requires a lookup. Where dbind would bind c to the value of (elt x 2),
with-places will make c a symbol-macro that expands into (elt x 2). So
if c is evaluated n times in the body, that will entail n calls to elt.
Unless you actually want to setf the variables created by destructuring,
dbind will be faster.

The definition of with-places is only slightly changed from that of
dbind (Figure 18.1). Within wplac-ex (formerly dbind-ex) the let has
become a symbol-macrolet. By similar alterations, we could make a
call-by-name version of any normal destructuring macro. 18.4 Matching

As destructuring is a generalization of assignment, pattern-matching is
a generalization of destructuring. The term "pattern-matching" has many
senses. In this context, it means comparing two structures, possibly
containing variables, to see if there is some way of assigning values to
the variables which makes the two equal. For example, if ?x and ?y are
variables, then the two lists

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (p ?x ?y c ?x)

    (p a b c a)
#+END_EXAMPLE

match when ?x = a and ?y = b. And the lists

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (p ?x b ?y a)

    (p ?y b c a)
#+END_EXAMPLE

match when ?x = ?y = c.

Suppose a program works by exchanging messages with some outside source.
To respond to a message, the program has to tell what kind of message it
is, and also to extract its specific content. With a matching operator
we can combine the two steps.

To be able to write such an operator we have to invent some way of
distinguishing variables. We can't just say that all symbols are
variables, because we will want symbols to occur as arguments within
patterns. Here we will say that a pattern variable is a symbol beginning
with a question mark. If it becomes inconvenient, this convention could
be changed simply by redefining the predicate var?.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun match (x y &optional binds)
      (acond2
       ((or (eql x y) (eql x '_) (eql y '_)) (values binds t))
       ((binding x binds) (match it y binds))
       ((binding y binds) (match x it binds))
       ((varsym? x) (values (cons (cons x y) binds) t))
       ((varsym? y) (values (cons (cons y x) binds) t))
       ((and (consp x) (consp y) (match (car x) (car y) binds))
        (match (cdr x) (cdr y) it))

                     it))))
        (let ((b (recbind x binds)))
          (values (cdr b) b))))

Figure 18.5: Matching function.

Figure 18.5 contains a pattern-matching function similar to ones that
appear in several introductions to Lisp. We give match two lists, and if
they can be made # to match, we will get back a list showing how:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (match '(p a b c a) '(p ?x ?y c ?x))
    ((?Y . B) (?X . A))
    T
    > (match '(p ?x b ?y a) '(p ?y b c a))
    ((?Y . C) (?X . ?Y))
    T
    > (match '(a b c) '(a a a))
    NIL
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

As match compares its arguments element by element, it builds up
assignments of values to variables, called bindings, in the parameter
binds. If the match is successful, match returns the bindings generated,
otherwise it returns nil. Since not all successful matches generate any
bindings, match, like gethash, returns a second value to indicate
whether the match succeeded or failed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (match '(p ?x) '(p ?x))
    NIL
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro if-match (pat seq then &optional else)
      `(aif2 (match ',pat ,seq)
         (let ,(mapcar #'(lambda (v)
                   `(,v (binding ',v it)))
                   (vars-in then #'atom))
           ,then)
         ,else))

    (defun vars-in (expr &optional (atom? #'atom))
      (if (funcall atom? expr)
          (if (var? expr) (list expr))
        (union (vars-in (car expr) atom?)
           (vars-in (cdr expr) atom?))))

    (defun var? (x)
      (and (symbolp x) (eq (char (symbol-name x) 0) #\?)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 18.6: Slow matching operator.

When match returns nil and t as above, it indicates a successful match
which yielded no bindings.

Like Prolog, match treats (underscore) as a wild-card. It matches
everything, and has no effect on the bindings:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (match '(a ?x b) '(_ 1 _))
    ((?X . 1))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

Given match, it is easy to write a pattern-matching version of dbind.
Figure 18.6 contains a macro called if-match. Like dbind, its first two
arguments are a pattern and a sequence, and it establishes bindings by
comparing the pattern with the sequence. However, instead of a body it
has two more arguments: a then clause to be evaluated, with new
bindings, if the match succeeds; and an else clause to be evaluated if
the match fails. Here is a simple function which uses if-match:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun abab (seq)
      (if-match (?x ?y ?x ?y) seq
            (values ?x ?y)
            nil))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If the match succeeds, it will establish values for ?x and ?y, which
will be returned:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (abab '(hi ho hi ho))
    HI
    HO
#+END_EXAMPLE

The function vars-in returns all the pattern variables in an expression.
It calls var? to test if something is a variable. At the moment, var? is
identical to varsym? (Figure 18.5), which is used to detect variables in
binding lists. We have two distinct functions in case we want to use
different representations for the two kinds of variables.

As defined in Figure 18.6, if-match is short, but not very efficient. It
does too much work at runtime. We traverse both sequences at runtime,
even though the first is known at compile-time. Worse still, during the
process of matching, we cons up lists to hold the variable bindings. If
we take advantage of information known at compile-time, we can write a
version of if-match which performs no unnecessary comparisons, and
doesn't cons at all.

If one of the sequences is known at compile-time, and only that one
contains variables, then we can go about things differently. In a call
to match, either argument could contain variables. By restricting
variables to the first argument of if-match, we make it possible to tell
at compile-time which variables will be involved in the match. Then
instead of creating lists of variable bindings, we could keep the values
of variables in the variables themselves.

The new version of if-match appears in Figure 18.7 and 18.8. When we can
predict what code would be evaluated at runtime, we can simply generate
it at compile-time. Here, instead of expanding into a call to match, we
generate code which performs just the right comparisons.

If we are going to use the variable ?x to contain the binding of ?x, how
do we represent a variable for which no binding has yet been established
by the match? Here we will indicate that a pattern variable is unbound
by binding it to a gensym. So if-match begins by generating code which
will bind all the variables in the pattern to gensyms. In this case,
instead of expanding into a with-gensyms, it's safe to make the gensyms
once at compile-time and insert them directly into the expansion.

The rest of the expansion is generated by pat-match. This macro takes
the same arguments as if-match; the only difference is that it
establishes no new bindings for pattern variables. In some situations
this is an advantage, and Chapter 19 will use pat-match as an operator
in its own right.

In the new matching operator, the distinction between pattern content
and pattern structure will be defined by the function simple?. If we
want to be able to use quoted literals in patterns, the destructuring
code (and vars-in) have to be told not to go inside lists whose first
element is quote. With the new matching operator, we will be able to use
lists as pattern elements, simply by quoting them.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro if-match (pat seq then &optional else)
      `(let ,(mapcar #'(lambda (v) `(,v ',(gensym)))
             (vars-in pat #'simple?))
         (pat-match ,pat ,seq ,then ,else)))

    (defmacro pat-match (pat seq then else)
      (if (simple? pat)
          (match1 `((,pat ,seq)) then else)
        (with-gensyms (gseq gelse)
              `(labels ((,gelse () ,else))
                 ,(gen-match (cons (list gseq seq)
                           (destruc pat gseq #'simple?))
                     then
                     `(,gelse))))))

    (defun simple? (x) (or (atom x) (eq (car x) 'quote)))

    (defun gen-match (refs then else)
      (if (null refs)
          then
        (let ((then (gen-match (cdr refs) then else)))
          (if (simple? (caar refs))
          (match1 refs then else)
        (gen-match (car refs) then else)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 18.7: Fast matching operator.

Like dbind, pat-match calls destruc to get a list of the calls that will
take apart its argument at runtime. This list is passed on to gen-match,
which recursively generates matching code for nested patterns, and
thence to match1, which generates match code for each leaf of the
pattern tree.

Most of the code which will appear in the expansion of an if-match comes
from match1, which is shown in Figure 18.8. This function considers four
cases. If the pattern argument is a gensym, then it is one of the
invisible variables created by destruc to hold sublists, and all we need
to do at runtime is test that it has the right length. If the pattern
element is a wildcard ( ), no code need be generated. If the pattern
element is a variable, match1 generates code to match it against, or set
it to, the corresponding part of the sequence given at runtime.
Otherwise, the pattern element is taken to be a literal value, and
match1 generates code to compare it with the corresponding part of the
sequence.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun match1 (refs then else)
      (dbind ((pat expr) . rest) refs
         (cond ((gensym? pat)
            `(let ((,pat ,expr))
               (if (and (typep ,pat 'sequence)
                    ,(length-test pat rest))
                   ,then
                 ,else)))
               ((eq pat '_) then)
               ((var? pat)
            (let ((ge (gensym)))
              `(let ((,ge ,expr))
                 (if (or (gensym? ,pat) (equal ,pat ,ge))
                 (let ((,pat ,ge)) ,then)
                   ,else))))
               (t `(if (equal ,pat ,expr) ,then ,else)))))

    (defun gensym? (s)
      (and (symbolp s) (not (symbol-package s))))

    (defun length-test (pat rest)
      (let ((fin (caadar (last rest))))
        (if (or (consp fin) (eq fin 'elt))
        `(= (length ,pat) ,(length rest))
          `(> (length ,pat) ,(- (length rest) 2)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 18.8: Fast matching operator (continued).

Let's look at examples of how some parts of the expansion are generated.
Suppose we begin with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (if-match (?x 'a) seq
          (print ?x)
          nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The pattern will be passed to destruc, with some gensym (call it g for
legibility) to represent the sequence:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (destruc '(?x 'a) 'g #'simple?)
#+END_EXAMPLE

yielding:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ((?x (elt g 0)) ((quote a) (elt g 1)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

On the front of this list we cons (g seq):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ((g seq) (?x (elt g 0)) ((quote a) (elt g 1)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and send the whole thing to gen-match. Like the naive implementation of
length (page 22), gen-match first recurses all the way to the end of the
list, and then builds its return value on the way back up. When it has
run out of elements, gen-match returns its then argument, which will be
?x. On the way back up the recursion, this return value will be passed
as the then argument to match1. Now we will have a call like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (match1 '(((quote a) (elt g 1))) '(print ?x) '#else function#)
#+END_EXAMPLE

yielding:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (if (equal (quote a) (elt g 1))
        (print ?x)
      #else function#)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will in turn become the then argument to another call to match1,
the value of which will become the then argument of the last call to
match1. The full expansion of this if-match is shown in Figure 18.9.

In this expansion gensyms are used in two completely unrelated ways. The
variables used to hold parts of the tree at runtime have gensymed names,
in order to avoid capture. And the variable ?x is initially bound to a
gensym, to indicate that it hasn't yet been assigned a value by
matching.

In the new if-match, the pattern elements are now evaluated instead of
being implicitly quoted. This means that Lisp variables can be used in
patterns, as well as quoted expressions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((n 3))
    (if-match (?x n 'n '(a b)) '(1 3 n (a b))
    ?x))
    1
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (if-match (?x 'a) seq
          (print ?x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

expands into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((?x '#:g1))
      (labels ((#:g3 nil nil))
        (let ((#:g2 seq))
          (if (and (typep #:g2 'sequence)
               (= (length #:g2) 2))
          (let ((#:g5 (elt #:g2 0)))
            (if (or (gensym? x) (equal ?x #:g5))
            (let ((?x #:g5))
              (if (equal 'a (elt #:g2 1))
                  (print ?x)
                (#:g3)))
              (#:g3)))
        (#:g3)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 18.9: Expansion of an if-match.

Two further improvements appear because the new version calls destruc
(Figure 18.1). The pattern can now contain &rest or &body keywords
(match doesn't bother with those). And because destruc uses the generic
sequence operators elt and subseq, the new if-match will work for any
kind of sequence. If abab is defined with the new version, it can be
used also on vectors and strings:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (abab "abab")
    #\a
    #\b
    > (abab #(1 2 1 2))
    1
    2
#+END_EXAMPLE

In fact, patterns can be as complex as patterns to dbind:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (if-match (?x (1 . ?y) . ?x) '((a b) #(1 2 3) a b)
    (values ?x ?y))
    (A B)
    #(2 3)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notice that, in the second return value, the elements of the vector are
displayed. To have vectors printed this way, set *print-array* to t.

In this chapter we are beginning to cross the line into a new kind of
programming. We began with simple macros for destructuring. In the final
version of if-match we have something that looks more like its own
language. The remaining chapters describe a whole class of programs
which operate on the same philosophy.

* 19. A Query Compiler
Some of the macros defined in the preceding chapter were large ones. To
generate its expansion, if-match needed all the code in Figures 18.7 and
18.8, plus destruc from Figure 18.1. Macros of this size lead naturally
to our last topic, embedded languages. If small macros are extensions to
Lisp, large macros define sub-languages within it--possibly with their
own syntax or control structure. We saw the beginning of this in
if-match, which had its own distinct representation for variables.

A language implemented within Lisp is called an embedded language. Like
"utility," the term is not a precisely defined one; if-match probably
still counts as a utility, but it is getting close to the borderline.

An embedded language is not a like a language implemented by a
traditional compiler or interpreter. It is implemented within some
existing language, usually by transformation. There need be no barrier
between the base language and the extension: it should be possible to
intermingle the two freely. For the implementor, this can mean a huge
saving of effort. You can embed just what you need, and for the rest,
use the base language.

Transformation, in Lisp, suggests macros. To some extent, you could
implement embedded languages with preprocessors. But preprocessors
usually operate only on text, while macros take advantage of a unique
property of Lisp: between the reader and the compiler, your Lisp program
is represented as lists of Lisp objects. Transformations done at this
stage can be much smarter.

The best-known example of an embedded language is CLOS, the Common Lisp
Object System. If youwanted to make an object-oriented version of a
conventional language, you would have to write a new compiler. Not so in
Lisp. Tuning the compiler will make CLOS run faster, but in principle
the compiler doesn't have to be changed at all. The whole thing can be
written in Lisp.

The remaining chapters give examples of embedded languages. This chapter
describes how to embed in Lisp a program to answer queries on a
database. (You will notice in this program a certain family resemblance
to if-match.) The first sections describe how to write a system which
interprets queries. This program is then reimplemented as a query
compiler--in essence, as one big macro--making it both more efficient
and better integrated with Lisp.

** 19.1 The Database
For our present purposes, the format of the database doesn't matter very
much. Here, for the sake of convenience, we will store information in
lists. For example, we will represent the fact that Joshua Reynolds was
an English painter who lived from 1723 to 1792 by:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (painter reynolds joshua english)

    (dates reynolds 1723 1792)
#+END_EXAMPLE

There is no canonical way of reducing information to lists. We could
just as well have used one big list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (painter reynolds joshua 1723 1792 english)
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is up to the user to decide how to organize database entries. The
only restriction is that the entries (facts) will be indexed under their
first element (the predicate). Within those bounds, any consistent form
will do, although some forms might make for faster queries than others.

Any database system needs at least two operations: one for modifying the
database, and one for examining it. The code shown in Figure 19.1
provides these operations in a basic form. A database is represented as
a hash-table filled with lists of facts, hashed according to their
predicate.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun make-db (&optional (size 100))
      (make-hash-table :size size))

    (defvar *default-db* (make-db))

    (defun clear-db (&optional (db *default-db*))
      (clrhash db))

    (defmacro db-query (key &optional (db '*default-db*))
      `(gethash ,key ,db))

    (defun db-push (key val &optional (db *default-db*))
      (push val (db-query key db)))

    (defmacro fact (pred &rest args)
      `(progn (db-push ',pred ',args)
          ',args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 19.1: Basic database functions.

Although the database functions defined in Figure 19.1 support multiple
databases, they all default to operations on *default-db*. As with
packages in Common Lisp, programs which don't need multiple databases
need not even mention them. In this chapter all the examples will just
use the *default-db*.

We initialize the system by calling clear-db, which empties the current
database. We can look up facts with a given predicate with db-query, and
insert new facts into a database entry with db-push. As explained in
Section 12.1, a macro which expands into an invertible reference will
itself be invertible. Since db-query is defined this way, we can simply
push new facts onto the db-query of their predicates. In Common Lisp,
hash-table entries are initialized to nil unless specified otherwise, so
any key initially has an empty list associated with it. Finally, the
macro fact adds a new fact to the database.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (fact painter reynolds joshua english)
    (REYNOLDS JOSHUA ENGLISH)
    > (fact painter canale antonio venetian)
    (CANALE ANTONIO VENETIAN)
    > (db-query 'painter)
    ((CANALE ANTONIO VENETIAN)
    (REYNOLDS JOSHUA ENGLISH))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

The t returned as the second value by db-query appears because db-query
expands into a gethash, which returns as its second value a flag to
distinguish between finding no entry and finding an entry whose value is
nil.

** 19.2 Pattern-Matching Queries
Calling db-query is not a very flexible way of looking at the contents
of the database. Usually the user wants to ask questions which depend on
more than just the first element of a fact. A query language is a
language for expressing more complicated questions. In a typical query
language, the user can ask for all the values which satisfy some
combination of restrictions--for example, the last names of all the
painters born in 1697.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #query# : (#symbol# #argument#*)
    : (not #query#)
    : (and #query#*)
    : (or #query#*)
    #argument# : ?#symbol#
    : #symbol#
    : #number#
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 19.2: Syntax of queries.

Our program will provide a declarative query language. In a declarative
query language, the user specifies the constraints which answers must
satisfy, and leaves it to the system to figure out how to generate them.
This way of expressing queries is close to the form people use in
everyday conversation. With our program, we will be able to express the
sample query by asking for all the x such that there is a fact of the
form (painter x ...), and a fact of the form (dates x 1697 ...). We will
be able to refer to all the painters born in 1697 by writing:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (and (painter ?x ?y ?z)
         (dates ?x 1697 ?w))
#+END_EXAMPLE

As well as accepting simple queries consisting of a predicate and some
arguments, our program will be able to answer arbitrarily complex
queries joined together by logical operators like and and or. The syntax
of the query language is shown in Figure 19.2.

Since facts are indexed under their predicates, variables cannot appear
in the predicate position. If you were willing to give up the benefits
of indexing, you could get around this restriction by always using the
same predicate, and making the first argument the de facto predicate.

Like many such systems, this program has a skeptic's notion of truth:
some facts are known, and everything else is false. The not operator
succeeds if the fact in question is not present in the database. To a
degree, you could represent explicit falsity by the Wayne's World
method:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (edible motor-oil not)
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, the not operator wouldn't treat these facts differently from
any others.

In programming languages there is a fundamental distinction between
interpreted and compiled programs. In this chapter we examine the same
question with respect to queries. A query interpreter accepts a query
and uses it to generate answers from the database. A query compiler
accepts a query and generates a program which, when run, yields the same
result. The following sections describe a query interpreter and then a
query compiler.

** 19.3 A Query Interpreter
To implement a declarative query language we will use the
pattern-matching utilities defined in Section 18.4. The functions shown
in Figure 19.3 interpret queries of the form shown in Figure 19.2. The
central function in this code is interpret-query, which recursively
works through the structure of a complex query, generating bindings in
the process. The evaluation of complex queries proceeds left-to-right,
as in Common Lisp itself.

When the recursion gets down to patterns for facts, interpret-query
calls lookup. This is where the pattern-matching occurs. The function
lookup takes a pattern consisting of a predicate and a list of
arguments, and returns a list of all the bindings which make the pattern
match some fact in the database. It gets all the database entries for
the predicate, and calls match (page 239) to compare each of them
against the pattern. Each successful match returns a list of bindings,
and lookup in turn returns a list of all these lists.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (lookup 'painter '(?x ?y english))
    (((?Y . JOSHUA) (?X . REYNOLDS)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

These results are then filtered or combined depending on the surrounding
logical operators. The final result is returned as a list of sets of
bindings. Given the assertions shown in Figure 19.4, here is the example
from earlier in this chapter:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (interpret-query '(and (painter ?x ?y ?z)
    (dates ?x 1697 ?w)))
    (((?W . 1768) (?Z . VENETIAN) (?Y . ANTONIO) (?X . CANALE))
    ((?W . 1772) (?Z . ENGLISH) (?Y . WILLIAM) (?X . HOGARTH)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

As a general rule, queries can be combined and nested without
restriction. In a few cases there are subtle restrictions on the syntax
of queries, but these are best dealt with after looking at some examples
of how this code is used.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-answer (query &body body)
      (let ((binds (gensym)))
        `(dolist (,binds (interpret-query ',query))
           (let ,(mapcar #'(lambda (v)
                 `(,v (binding ',v ,binds)))
                 (vars-in query #'atom))
         ,@body))))

    (defun interpret-query (expr &optional binds)
      (case (car expr)
        (and (interpret-and (reverse (cdr expr)) binds))
        (or (interpret-or (cdr expr) binds))
        (not (interpret-not (cadr expr) binds))
        (t (lookup (car expr) (cdr expr) binds))))

    (defun interpret-and (clauses binds)
      (if (null clauses)
          (list binds)
        (mapcan #'(lambda (b)
            (interpret-query (car clauses) b))
            (interpret-and (cdr clauses) binds))))

    (defun interpret-or (clauses binds)
      (mapcan #'(lambda (c)
              (interpret-query c binds))
          clauses))

    (defun interpret-not (clause binds)
      (if (interpret-query clause binds)
          nil
        (list binds)))

    (defun lookup (pred args &optional binds)
      (mapcan #'(lambda (x)
              (aif2 (match x args binds) (list it)))
          (db-query pred)))

The macro with-answer provides a clean way of using the query
interpreter within Lisp programs. It takes as its first argument any
legal query; the rest of the arguments are treated as a body of code. A
with-answer expands into code which collects all the sets of bindings
generated by the query, then iterates through the body with the
variables in the query bound as specified by each set of bindings.
Variables which appear in the query of a with-answer can (usually) be
used within its body. When the query is successful but contains no
variables, with-answer evaluates the body of code just once.

With the database as defined in Figure 19.4, Figure 19.5 shows some
sample queries, accompanied by English translations. Because
pattern-matching is done with match, it is possible to use the
underscore as a wild-card in patterns.

To keep these examples short, the code within the bodies of the queries
does nothing more than print some result. In general, the body of a
with-answer can consist of any Lisp expressions.

<<Restrictions on Binding>><<SEC124>>

** 19.4 Restrictions on Binding
There are some restrictions on which variables will be bound by a query.
For example, why should the query

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (not (painter ?x ?y ?z))
#+END_EXAMPLE

assign any bindings to ?x and ?y at all? There are an infinite number of
combinations of ?x and ?y which are not the name of some painter. Thus
we add the following restriction: the not operator will filter out
bindings which are already generated, as in

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (and (painter ?x ?y ?z) (not (dates ?x 1772 ?d)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

but you cannot expect it to generate bindings all by itself. We have to
generate sets of bindings by looking for painters before we can screen
out the ones not born in 1772. If we had put the clauses in the reverse
order:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (and (not (dates ?x 1772 ?d)) (painter ?x ?y ?z)) ; wrong
#+END_EXAMPLE

The first name and nationality of every painter called Hogarth.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-answer (painter hogarth ?x ?y)
    (princ (list ?x ?y)))
    (WILLIAM ENGLISH)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

The last name of every painter born in 1697. (Our original example.)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-answer (and (painter ?x _ _)
    (dates ?x 1697 _))
    (princ (list ?x)))
    (CANALE)(HOGARTH)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

The last name and year of birth of everyone who died in 1772 or 1792.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-answer (or (dates ?x ?y 1772)
    (dates ?x ?y 1792))
    (princ (list ?x ?y)))
    (HOGARTH 1697)(REYNOLDS 1723)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

The last name of every English painter not born the same year as a
Venetian one.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-answer (and (painter ?x _ english)
    (dates ?x ?b _)
    (not (and (painter ?x2 _ venetian)
    (dates ?x2 ?b _))))
    (princ ?x))
    REYNOLDS
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 19.5: The query interpreter in use.

<<IDX110>>

then we would get nil as the result if there were any painters born in
1772. Even in the first example, we shouldn't expect to be able to use
the value of ?d within the body of a with-answer expression.

Also, expressions of the form (or q 1 . . . qn ) are only guaranteed to
generate real bindings for variables which appear in all of the q i . If
a with-answer contained the query

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (or (painter ?x ?y ?z) (dates ?x ?b ?d))
#+END_EXAMPLE

you could expect to use the binding of ?x, because no matter which of
the subqueries succeeds, it will generate a binding for ?x. But neither
?y nor ?b is guaranteed to get a binding from the query, though one or
the other will. Pattern variables not bound by the query will be nil for
that iteration.

<<A Query Compiler (AQC)>><<SEC125>>

** 19.5 A Query Compiler
The code in Figure 19.3 does what we want, but inefficiently. It
analyzes the structure of the query at runtime, though it is known at
compile-time. And it conses up lists to hold variable bindings, when we
could use the variables to hold their own values. Both of these problems
can be solved by defining with-answer in a different way.

Figure 19.6 defines a new version of with-answer. The new version
continues a trend which began with avg (page 182), and continued with
if-match (page 242): it does at compile-time much of the work that the
old version did at runtime. The code in Figure 19.6 bears a superficial
resemblance to that in Figure 19.3, but none of these functions are
called at runtime. Instead of generating bindings, they generate code,
which becomes part of the expansion of with-answer. At runtime this code
will generate all the bindings which satisfy the query according to the
current state of the database.

In effect, this program is one big macro. Figure 19.7 shows the
macroexpansion of a with-answer. Most of the work is done by pat-match
(page 242), which is itself a macro. Now the only new functions needed
at runtime are the basic database functions shown in Figure 19.1.

When with-answer is called from the toplevel, query compilation has
little advantage. The code representing the query is generated,
evaluated, then thrown away. But when a with-answer expression appears
within a Lisp program, the code representing the query becomes part of
its macroexpansion. So when the containing program is compiled, the code
for all the queries will be compiled inline in the process.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-answer (query &body body)
      `(with-gensyms ,(vars-in query #'simple?)
             ,(compile-query query `(progn ,@body))))

    (defun compile-query (q body)
      (case (car q)
        (and (compile-and (cdr q) body))
        (or (compile-or (cdr q) body))
        (not (compile-not (cadr q) body))
        (lisp `(if ,(cadr q) ,body))
        (t (compile-simple q body))))

    (defun compile-simple (q body)
      (let ((fact (gensym)))
        `(dolist (,fact (db-query ',(car q)))
           (pat-match ,(cdr q) ,fact ,body nil))))

    (defun compile-and (clauses body)
      (if (null clauses)
          body
        (compile-query (car clauses)
               (compile-and (cdr clauses) body))))

    (defun compile-or (clauses body)
      (if (null clauses)
          nil
        (let ((gbod (gensym))
          (vars (vars-in body #'simple?)))
          `(labels ((,gbod ,vars ,body))
         ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (cl)
                (compile-query cl `(,gbod ,@vars)))
                clauses)))))

    (defun compile-not (q body)
      (let ((tag (gensym)))
        `(if (block ,tag
           ,(compile-query q `(return-from ,tag nil))
           t)
         ,body)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 19.6: Query compiler.

<<IDX111>>

Although the primary advantage of the new approach is speed, it also
makes with-answer expressions better integrated with the code in which
they appear. This shows in two specific improvements. First, the
arguments within the query now get evaluated, so we can say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq my-favorite-year 1723)
    1723
    > (with-answer (dates ?x my-favorite-year ?d)
    (format t "~A was born in my favorite year.~%" ?x))
    REYNOLDS was born in my favorite year.
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (with-answer (painter ?x ?y ?z)
             (format t "~A ~A is a painter.~%" ?y ?x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

is expanded by the query interpreter into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (dolist (#:g1 (interpret-query '(painter ?x ?y ?z)))
      (let ((?x (binding '?x #:g1))
        (?y (binding '?y #:g1))
        (?z (binding '?z #:g1)))
        (format t "~A ~A is a painter.~%" ?y ?x)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and by the query compiler into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (with-gensyms (?x ?y ?z)
              (dolist (#:g1 (db-query 'painter))
            (pat-match (?x ?y ?z) #:g1
                   (progn
                     (format t "~A ~A is a painter.~%" ?y ?x))
                   nil)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 19.7: Two expansions of the same query.

<<IDX112>>

This could have been done in the query interpreter, but only at the cost
of calling eval explicitly. And even then, it wouldn't have been
possible to refer to lexical variables in the query arguments.

Since arguments within queries are now evaluated, any literal argument
(e.g. english) that doesn't evaluate to itself should now be quoted.
(See Figure 19.8.)

The second advantage of the new approach is that it is now much easier
to include normal Lisp expressions within queries. The query compiler
adds a lisp operator, which may be followed by any Lisp expression. Like
the not operator, it cannot generate bindings by itself, but it will
screen out bindings for which the expression returns nil. The lisp
operator is useful for getting at built-in predicates like >:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-answer (and (dates ?x ?b ?d)
    (lisp (> (- ?d ?b) 70)))
    (format t "~A lived over 70 years.~%" ?x))
    CANALE lived over 70 years.
    HOGARTH lived over 70 years.
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

A well-implemented embedded language can have a seamless interface with
the base language on both sides.

The first name and nationality of every painter called Hogarth.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-answer (painter 'hogarth ?x ?y)
    (princ (list ?x ?y)))
    (WILLIAM ENGLISH)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

The last name of every English painter not born in the same year as a
Venetian painter.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-answer (and (painter ?x _ 'english)
    (dates ?x ?b _)
    (not (and (painter ?x2 _ 'venetian)
    (dates ?x2 ?b _))))
    (princ ?x))
    REYNOLDS
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

The last name and year of death of every painter who died between 1770
and 1800 exclusive.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-answer (and (painter ?x _ _)
    (dates ?x _ ?d)
    (lisp (< 1770 ?d 1800)))
    (princ (list ?x ?d)))
    (REYNOLDS 1792)(HOGARTH 1772)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 19.8: The query compiler in use.

<<IDX113>>

Aside from these two additions--the evaluation of arguments and the new
lisp operator--the query language supported by the query compiler is
identical to that supported by the interpreter. Figure 19.8 shows
examples of the results generated by the query compiler with the
database as defined in Figure 19.4.

Section 17.2 gave two reasons why it is better to compile an expression
than feed it, as a list, to eval. The former is faster, and allows the
expression to be evaluated in the surrounding lexical context. The
advantages of query compilation are exactly analogous. Work that used to
be done at runtime is now done at compile-time. And because the queries
are compiled as a piece with the surrounding Lisp code, they can take
advantage of the lexical context.

<<SEC126>>

* 20. Continuations
A continuation is a program frozen in action: a single functional object
containing the state of a computation. When the object is evaluated, the
stored computation is restarted where it left off. In solving certain
types of problems it can be a great help to be able to save the state of
a program and restart it later. In multiprocessing, for example, a
continuation conveniently represents a suspended process. In
nondeterministic search programs, a continuation can represent a node in
the search tree.

Continuations can be difficult to understand. This chapter approaches
the topic in two steps. The first part of the chapter looks at the use
of continuations in Scheme, which has built-in support for them. Once
the behavior of continuations # has been explained, the second part
shows how to use macros to build continuations in Common Lisp programs.
Chapters 21--24 will all make use of the macros defined here.

** 20.1 Scheme Continuations
One of the principal ways in which Scheme differs from Common Lisp is
its explicit support for continuations. This section shows how
continuations work in Scheme. (Figure 20.1 lists some other differences
between Scheme and Common Lisp.)

1. Scheme makes no distinction between what Common Lisp calls the
   symbol-value and symbol-function of a symbol. In Scheme, a variable
   has a single value, which can be either a function or some other sort
   of object. Thus there is no need for sharp-quote or funcall in
   Scheme. The Common Lisp:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       (let ((f #'(lambda (x) (1+ x))))
         (funcall f 2))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   would be in Scheme:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       (let ((f (lambda (x) (1+ x))))
         (f 2))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. Since Scheme has only one name-space, it doesn't need separate
   operators (e.g. defun and setq) for assignments in each. Instead it
   has define, which is roughly equivalent to defvar, and set!, which
   takes the place of setq. Global variables must be created with define
   before they can be set with set!.
3. In Scheme, named functions are usually defined with define, which
   takes the place of defun as well as defvar. The Common Lisp:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       (defun foo (x) (1+ x))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   has two possible Scheme translations:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       (define foo (lambda (x) (1+ x)))

       (define (foo x) (1+ x))
   #+END_EXAMPLE

4. In Common Lisp, the arguments to a function are evaluated
   left-to-right. In Scheme, the order of evaluation is deliberately
   unspecified. (And implementors delight in surprising those who forget
   this.)
5. Instead of t and nil, Scheme has #t and #f. The empty list, (), is
   true in some implementations and false in others.
6. The default clause in cond and case expressions has the key else in
   Scheme, instead of t as in Common Lisp.
7. Several built-in operators have different names: consp is pair?, null
   is null?, mapcar is (almost) map, and so on. Ordinarily these should
   be obvious from the context.

Figure 20.1: Some differences between Scheme and Common Lisp.

<<IDX114>>

A continuation is a function representing the future of a computation.
Whenever an expression is evaluated, something is waiting for the value
it will return. For example, in

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (/ (- x 1) 2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

when (- x 1) is evaluated, the outer / expression is waiting for the
value, and something else is waiting for its value, and so on and so on,
all the way back to the toplevel--where print is waiting.

We can think of the continuation at any given time as a function of one
argument. If the previous expression were typed into the toplevel, then
when the subexpression (- x 1) was evaluated, the continuation would be:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (lambda (val) (/ val 2))
#+END_EXAMPLE

That is, the remainder of the computation could be duplicated by calling
this function on the return value. If instead the expression occurred in
the following context

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define (f1 w)
      (let ((y (f2 w)))
        (if (integer? y) (list 'a y) 'b)))

    (define (f2 x)
      (/ (- x 1) 2))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and f1 were called from the toplevel, then when (- x 1) was evaluated,
the continuation would be equivalent to

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (lambda (val)
      (let ((y (/ val 2)))
        (if (integer? y) (list 'a y) 'b)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

In Scheme, continuations are first-class objects, just like functions.
You can ask Scheme for the current continuation, and it will make you a
function of one argument representing the future of the computation. You
can save this object for as long as you like, and when you call it, it
will restart the computation that was taking place when it was created.

Continuations can be understood as a generalization of closures. A
closure is a function plus pointers to the lexical variables visible at
the time it was created. A continuation is a function plus a pointer to
the whole stack pending at the time it was created. When a continuation
is evaluated, it returns a value using its own copy of the stack,
ignoring the current one. If a continuation is created at T 1 and
evaluated at T 2 , it will be evaluated with the stack that was pending
at T 1 .

Scheme programs have access to the current continuation via the built-in
operator call-with-current-continuation (call/cc for short). When a
program calls call/cc on a function of one argument:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (call-with-current-continuation
     (lambda (cc)
       ...))
#+END_EXAMPLE

the function will be passed another function representing the current
continuation. By storing the value of cc somewhere, we save the state of
the computation at the point of the call/cc.

In this example, we append together a list whose last element is the
value returned by a call/cc expression:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (define frozen)
    FROZEN
    > (append '(the call/cc returned)
    (list (call-with-current-continuation
    (lambda (cc)
    (set! frozen cc)
    'a))))
    (THE CALL/CC RETURNED A)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The call/cc returns a, but first saves the continuation in the global
variable frozen.

Calling frozen will restart the old computation at the point of the
call/cc. Whatever value we pass to frozen will be returned as the value
of the call/cc:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (frozen 'again)
    (THE CALL/CC RETURNED AGAIN)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Continuations aren't used up by being evaluated. They can be called
repeatedly, just like any other functional object:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (frozen 'thrice)
    (THE CALL/CC RETURNED THRICE)
#+END_EXAMPLE

When we call a continuation within some other computation, we see more
clearly what it means to return back up the old stack:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (+ 1 (frozen 'safely))
    (THE CALL/CC RETURNED SAFELY)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here, the pending + is ignored when frozen is called. The latter returns
up the stack that was pending at the time it was first created: through
list, then append, to the toplevel. If frozen returned a value like a
normal function call, the expression above would have yielded an error
when + tried to add 1 to a list.

Continuations do not get unique copies of the stack. They may share
variables with other continuations, or with the computation currently in
progress. In this example, two continuations share the same stack:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (define froz1)
    FROZ1
    > (define froz2)
    FROZ2
    > (let ((x 0))
    (call-with-current-continuation
    (lambda (cc)
    (set! froz1 cc)
    (set! froz2 cc)))
    (set! x (1+ x))
    x)
    1
#+END_EXAMPLE

so calls to either will return successive integers:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (froz2 ())
    2
    > (froz1 ())
    3
#+END_EXAMPLE

Since the value of the call/cc expression will be discarded, it doesn't
matter what argument we give to froz1 and froz2.

Now that we can store the state of a computation, what do we do with it?
Chapters 21--24 are devoted to applications which use continuations.
Here we will consider a simple example which conveys well the flavor of
programming with saved states: we have a set of trees, and we want to
generate lists containing one element from each tree, until we get a
combination satisfying some condition.

Trees can be represented as nested lists. Page 70 described a way to
represent one kind of tree as a list. Here we use another, which allows
interior nodes to have (atomic) values, and any number of children. In
this representation, an interior node becomes a list; its car contains
the value stored at the node, and its cdr contains the representations
of the node's children. For example, the two trees shown in Figure 20.2
can be represented:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define t1 '(a (b (d h)) (c e (f i) g)))

    (define t2 '(1 (2 (3 6 7) 4 5)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 20.3 contains functions which do depth-first traversals on such
trees. In a real program we would want to do something with the nodes as
we encountered them. Here we just print them. The function dft, given
for comparison, does an ordinary depth-first traversal:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (dft t1)
    ABDHCEFIG()
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 20.2: Two Trees.

<<IDX115>>

The function dft-node follows the same path through the tree, but deals
out nodes one at a time. When dft-node reaches a node, it follows the
car of the node, and pushes onto *saved* a continuation to explore the
cdr.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (dft-node t1)
    A
#+END_EXAMPLE

Calling restart continues the traversal, by popping the most recently
saved continuation and calling it.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (restart)
    B
#+END_EXAMPLE

Eventually there will be no saved states left, a fact which restart
signals by returning done:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    . . .
    > (restart)
    G
    > (restart)
    DONE
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, the function dft2 neatly packages up what we just did by hand:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (dft2 t1)
    ABDHCEFIG()
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define (dft tree)
      (cond ((null? tree) ())
        ((not (pair? tree)) (write tree))
        (else (dft (car tree))
              (dft (cdr tree)))))

    (define *saved* ())

    (define (dft-node tree)
      (cond ((null? tree) (restart))
        ((not (pair? tree)) tree)
        (else (call-with-current-continuation
               (lambda (cc)
             (set! *saved*
                   (cons (lambda ()
                       (cc (dft-node (cdr tree))))
                     *saved*))
             (dft-node (car tree)))))))

    (define (restart)
      (if (null? *saved*)
          'done
        (let ((cont (car *saved*)))
          (set! *saved* (cdr *saved*))
          (cont))))

    (define (dft2 tree)
      (set! *saved* ())
      (let ((node (dft-node tree)))
        (cond ((eq? node 'done) ())
          (else (write node)
            (restart)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 20.3: Tree traversal using continuations.

<<IDX116>>

Notice that there is no explicit recursion or iteration in the
definition of dft2: successive nodes are printed because the
continuations invoked by restart always return back through the same
cond clause in dft-node.

This kind of program works like a mine. It digs the initial shaft by
calling dft-node. So long as the value returned is not done, the code
following the call to dft-node will call restart, which sends control
back down the stack again. This process continues until the return value
signals that the mine is empty. Instead of printing this value, dft2
returns #f. Search with continuations represents a novel way of thinking
about programs: put the right code in the stack, and get the result by
repeatedly returning up through it.

If we only want to traverse one tree at a time, as in dft2, then there
is no reason to bother using this technique. The advantage of dft-node
is that we can have several instances of it going at once. Suppose we
have two trees, and we want to generate, in depth-first order, the
cross-product of their elements.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (set! *saved* ())
    ()
    > (let ((node1 (dft-node t1)))
    (if (eq? node1 'done)
    'done
    (list node1 (dft-node t2))))
    (A 1)
    > (restart)
    (A 2)
    . . .
    > (restart)
    (B 1)
    . . .
#+END_EXAMPLE

Using normal techniques, we would have had to take explicit steps to
save our place in the two trees. With continuations, the state of the
two ongoing traversals is maintained automatically. In a simple case
like this one, saving our place in the tree would not be so difficult.
The trees are permanent data structures, so at least we have some way of
getting hold of "our place" in the tree. The great thing about
continuations is that they can just as easily save our place in the
middle of any computation, even if there are no permanent data
structures associated with it. The computation need not even have a
finite number of states, so long as we only want to restart a finite
number of them.

As Chapter 24 will show, both of these considerations turn out to be
important in the implementation of Prolog. In Prolog programs, the
"search trees" are not real data structures, but are implicit in the way
the program generates results. And the trees are often infinite, in
which case we cannot hope to search the whole of one before searching
the next; we have no choice but to save our place, one way or another.

<<Continuation-Passing Macros>><<SEC128>>

** 20.2 Continuation-Passing Macros
Common Lisp doesn't provide call/cc, but with a little extra effort we
can do the same things as we can in Scheme. This section shows how to
use macros to build continuations in Common Lisp programs. Scheme
continuations gave us two things:

1. The bindings of all variables at the time the continuation was made.
2. The state of the computation--what was going to happen from then on.

In a lexically scoped Lisp, closures give us the first of these. It
turns out that we can also use closures to maintain the second, by
storing the state of the computation in variable bindings as well.

The macros shown in Figure 20.4 make it possible to do function calls
while preserving continuations. These macros replace the built-in Common
Lisp forms for defining functions, calling them, and returning values.

Functions which want to use continuations (or call functions which do)
should be defined with =defun instead of defun. The syntax of =defun is
the same as # that of defun, but its effect is subtly different. Instead
of defining just a function, =defun defines a function and a macro which
expands into a call to it. (The macro must be defined first, in case the
function calls itself.) The function will have the body that was passed
to =defun, but will have an additional parameter, *cont*, consed onto
its parameter list. In the expansion of the macro, this function will
receive *cont* along with its other arguments. So

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (=defun add1 (x) (=values (1+ x)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

macroexpands into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (progn (defmacro add1 (x)
         `(=add1 *cont* ,x))
           (defun =add1 (*cont* x)
         (=values (1+ x))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

When we call add1, we are actually calling not a function but a macro.
The macro expands into a function call,[fn:32] but with one
extra parameter: *cont*. So the current value of *cont* is always passed
implicitly in a call to an operator defined with =defun.

What is *cont* for? It will be bound to the current continuation. The
definition of =values shows how this continuation will be used. Any
function defined using =defun must return with =values, or call some
other function which does so. The syntax of =values is the same as that
of the Common Lisp form values. It can return multiple values if there
is an =bind with the same number of arguments waiting for them, but
can't return multiple values to the toplevel. #

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq *cont* #'identity)

    (defmacro =lambda (parms &body body)
      `#'(lambda (*cont* ,@parms) ,@body))

    (defmacro =defun (name parms &body body)
      (let ((f (intern (concatenate 'string
                    "=" (symbol-name name)))))
        `(progn
           (defmacro ,name ,parms
         `(,',f *cont* ,,@parms))
           (defun ,f (*cont* ,@parms) ,@body))))

    (defmacro =bind (parms expr &body body)
      `(let ((*cont* #'(lambda ,parms ,@body))) ,expr))

    (defmacro =values (&rest retvals)
      `(funcall *cont* ,@retvals))

    (defmacro =funcall (fn &rest args)
      `(funcall ,fn *cont* ,@args))

    (defmacro =apply (fn &rest args)
      `(apply ,fn *cont* ,@args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 20.4: Continuation-passing macros.

<<IDX117>>

The parameter *cont* tells a function defined with =defun what to do
with its return value. When =values is macroexpanded it will capture
*cont*, and use it to simulate returning from the function. The
expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (=values (1+ n))
#+END_EXAMPLE

expands into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (funcall *cont* (1+ n))
#+END_EXAMPLE

At the toplevel, the value of *cont* is identity, which just returns
whatever is passed to it. When we call (add1 2) from the toplevel, the
call gets macroexpanded into the equivalent of

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (funcall #'(lambda (*cont* n) (=values (1+ n))) *cont* 2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The reference to *cont* will in this case get the global binding. The
=values expression will thus macroexpand into the equivalent of:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (funcall #'identity (1+ n))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which just adds 1 to n and returns the result.

In functions like add1, we go through all this trouble just to simulate
what Lisp function call and return do anyway:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (=defun bar (x)
    (=values (list 'a (add1 x))))
    BAR
    > (bar 5)
    (A 6)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The point is, we have now brought function call and return under our own
control, and can do other things if we wish.

It is by manipulating *cont* that we will get the effect of
continuations. Although *cont* has a global value, this will rarely be
the one used: *cont* will nearly always be a parameter, captured by
=values and the macros defined by =defun. Within the body of add1, for
example, *cont* is a parameter and not the global variable. This
distinction is important because these macros wouldn't work if *cont*
were not a local variable. That's why *cont* is given its initial value
in a setq instead of a defvar: the latter would also proclaim it to be
special.

The third macro in Figure 20.4, =bind, is intended to be used in the
same way as multiple-value-bind. It takes a list of parameters, an
expression, and a body of code: the parameters are bound to the values
returned by the expression, and the code body is evaluated with those
bindings. This macro should be used whenever additional expressions have
to be evaluated after calling a function defined with =defun.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (=defun message ()
    (=values 'hello 'there))
    MESSAGE
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (=defun baz ()
    (=bind (m n) (message)
    (=values (list m n))))
    BAZ
    > (baz)
    (HELLO THERE)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notice that the expansion of an =bind creates a new variable called
*cont*. The body of baz macroexpands into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((*cont* #'(lambda (m n)
              (=values (list m n)))))
      (message))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which in turn becomes:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((*cont* #'(lambda (m n)
              (funcall *cont* (list m n)))))
      (=message *cont*))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The new value of *cont* is the body of the =bind expression, so when
message "returns" by funcalling *cont*, the result will be to evaluate
the body of code. However (and this is the key point), within the body
of the =bind:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #'
    (lambda (m n)
        (funcall *cont* (list m n)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

the *cont* that was passed as an argument to =baz is still visible, so
when the body of code in turn evaluates an =values, it will be able to
return to the original calling function. The closures are knitted
together: each binding of *cont* is a closure containing the previous
binding of *cont*, forming a chain which leads all the way back up to
the global value.

We can see the same phenomenon on a smaller scale here:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((f #'identity))
    (let ((g #'(lambda (x) (funcall f (list 'a x)))))
    #'(lambda (x) (funcall g (list 'b x)))))
    #<Interpreted-Function BF6326>
    > (funcall * 2)
    (A (B 2))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This example creates a function which is a closure containing a
reference to g, which is itself a closure containing a reference to f.
Similar chains of closures were built by the network compiler on page
80.

1. The parameter list of a function defined with =defun must consist
   solely of parameter names.
2. Functions which make use of continuations, or call other functions
   which do, must be defined with =lambda or =defun.
3. Such functions must terminate either by returning values with
   =values, or by calling another function which obeys this restriction.
4. If an =bind, =values, =apply, or =funcall expression occurs in a
   segment of code, it must be a tail call. Any code to be evaluated
   after an =bind should be put in its body. So if we want to have
   several =binds one after another, they must be nested:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (=defun foo (x)
        (=bind (y) (bar x)
               (format t "Ho ")
               (=bind (z) (baz x)
                  (format t "Hum.")
                  (=values x y z))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 20.5: Restrictions on continuation-passing macros.

<<IDX118>>

The remaining macros, =apply and =funcall, are for use with functions
defined by =lambda. Note that "functions" defined with =defun, because
they are actually macros, cannot be given as arguments to apply or
funcall. The way around this problem is analogous to the trick mentioned
on page 110. It is to package up the call inside another =lambda:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (=defun add1 (x)
    (=values (1+ x)))
    ADD1
    > (let ((fn (=lambda (n) (add1 n))))
    (=bind (y) (=funcall fn 9)
    (format nil "9 + 1 = ~A" y)))
    "9 + 1 = 10"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 20.5 summarizes all the restrictions imposed by the
continuation-passing macros. Functions which neither save continuations,
nor call other functions which do, need not use these special macros.
Built-in functions like list, for example, are exempt.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun dft (tree)
      (cond ((null tree) nil)
        ((atom tree) (princ tree))
        (t (dft (car tree))
           (dft (cdr tree)))))

    (setq *saved* nil)

    (=defun dft-node (tree)
        (cond ((null tree) (restart))
              ((atom tree) (=values tree))
              (t (push #'(lambda () (dft-node (cdr tree)))
                   *saved*)
             (dft-node (car tree)))))

    (=defun restart ()
        (if *saved*
            (funcall (pop *saved*))
          (=values 'done)))

    (=defun dft2 (tree)
        (setq *saved* nil)
        (=bind (node) (dft-node tree)
               (cond ((eq node 'done) (=values nil))
                 (t (princ node)
                (restart)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 20.6: Tree traversal using continuation-passing macros.

<<IDX119>>

Figure 20.6 contains the code from Figure 20.3, translated from Scheme
into Common Lisp, and using the continuation-passing macros instead of
Scheme continuations. With the same example tree, dft2 works just as
before:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq t1 '(a (b (d h)) (c e (f i) g))
    t2 '(1 (2 (3 6 7) 4 5)))
    (1 (2 (3 6 7) 4 5))
    > (dft2 t1)
    ABDHCEFIG
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Saving states of multiple traversals also works as in Scheme, though the
example becomes a bit longer:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (=bind (node1) (dft-node t1)
    (if (eq node1 'done)
    'done
    (=bind (node2) (dft-node t2)
    (list node1 node2))))
    (A 1)
    > (restart)
    (A 2)
    . . .
    > (restart)
    (B 1)
    . . .
#+END_EXAMPLE

By knitting together a chain of lexical closures, Common Lisp programs
can build their own continuations. Fortunately, the closures are knitted
together by the macros in the sweatshop of Figure 20.4, and the user can
have the finished garment without giving a thought to its origins.

Chapters 21--24 all rely on continuations in some way. These chapters
will show that continuations are an abstraction of unusual power. They
may not be overly fast, especially when implemented on top of the
language as macros, but the abstractions we can build upon them make
certain programs much faster to write, and there is a place for that
kind of speed too.

<<Code-Walkers and CPS Conversion>><<SEC129>>

** 20.3 Code-Walkers and CPS Conversion
The macros described in the previous section represent a compromise.
They give us the power of continuations, but only if we write our
programs in a certain way. Rule 4 in Figure 20.5 means that we always
have to write

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (=bind (x) (fn y)
           (list 'a x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

rather than

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (list 'a               ; wrong
          (=bind (x) (fn y) x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

A true call/cc imposes no such restrictions on the programmer. A call/cc
can grab the continuation at any point in a program of any shape. We
could implement an operator with the full power of call/cc, but it would
be a lot more work. This section outlines how it could be done.

A Lisp program can be transformed into a form called
"continuation-passing style." Programs which have undergone complete CPS
conversion are impossible to read, but one can grasp the spirit of this
process by looking at code which has been partially transformed. The
following function to reverse lists: #

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun rev (x)
      (if (null x)
          nil
        (append (rev (cdr x)) (list (car x)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

yields an equivalent continuation-passing version:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun rev2 (x)
      (revc x #'identity))

    (defun revc (x k)
      (if (null x)
          (funcall k nil)
        (revc (cdr x)
          #'(lambda (w)
              (funcall k (append w (list (car x))))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the continuation-passing style, functions get an additional parameter
(here k) whose value will be the continuation. The continuation is a
closure representing what should be done with the current value of the
function. On the first recursion, the continuation is identity; what
should be done is that the function should just return its current
value. On the second recursion, the continuation will be equivalent to:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #'
    (lambda (w)
        (identity (append w (list (car x)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which says that what should be done is to append the car of the list to
the current value, and return it.

Once you can do CPS conversion, it is easy to write call/cc. In a
program which has undergone CPS conversion, the entire current
continuation is always present, and call/cc can be implemented as a
simple macro which calls some function with it as an argument.

To do CPS conversion we need a code-walker, a program that traverses the
trees representing the source code of a program. Writing a code-walker
for Common Lisp is a serious undertaking. To be useful, a code-walker
has to do # more than simply traverse expressions. It also has to know a
fair amount about what the expressions mean. A code-walker can't just
think in terms of symbols, for example. A symbol could represent, among
other things, itself, a function, a variable, a block name, or a tag for
go. The code-walker has to use the context to distinguish one kind of
symbol from another, and act accordingly.

Since writing a code-walker would be beyond the scope of this book, the
macros described in this chapter are the most practical alternative. The
macros in this chapter split the work of building continuations with the
user. If the user writes programs in something sufficiently close to
CPS, the macros can do the rest. That's what rule 4 really amounts to:
if everything following an =bind expression is within its body, then
between the value of *cont* and the code in the body of the =bind, the
program has enough information to construct the current continuation.

The =bind macro is deliberately written to make this style of
programming feel natural. In practice the restrictions imposed by the
continuation-passing macros are bearable.

<<SEC130>>

* 21. Multiple Processes
The previous chapter showed how continuations allow a running program to
get hold of its own state, and store it away to be restarted later. This
chapter deals with a model of computation in which a computer runs not
one single program, but a collection of independent processes. The
concept of a process corresponds closely with our concept of the state
of a program. By writing an additional layer of macros on top of those
in the previous chapter, we can embed multiprocessing in Common Lisp
programs.

** 21.1 The Process Abstraction
Multiple processes are a convenient way of expressing programs which
must do several things at once. A traditional processor executes one
instruction at a time. To say that multiple processes do more than one
thing at once is not to say that they somehow overcome this hardware
limitation: what it means is that they allow us to think at a new level
of abstraction, in which we don't have to specify exactly what the
computer is doing at any given time. Just as virtual memory allows us to
act as though the computer had more memory than it actually does, the
notion of a process allows us to act as if the computer could run more
than one program at a time.

The study of processes is traditionally in the domain of operating
systems. But the usefulness of processes as an abstraction is not
limited to operating systems. They are equally useful in other real-time
applications, and in simulations.

Much of the work done on multiple processes has been devoted to avoiding
certain types of problems. Deadlock is one classic problem with multiple
processes: two processes both stand waiting for the other to do
something, like two people who each refuse to cross a threshold before
the other. Another problem is the query which catches the system in an
inconsistent state--say, a balance inquiry which arrives while the
system is transferring funds from one account to another. This chapter
deals only with the process abstraction itself; the code presented here
could be used to test algorithms for preventing deadlock or inconsistent
states, but it does not itself provide any protection against these
problems.

The implementation in this chapter follows a rule implicit in all the
programs in this book: disturb Lisp as little as possible. In spirit, a
program ought to be as much as possible like a modification of the
language, rather than a separate application written in it. Making
programs harmonize with Lisp makes them more robust, like a machine
whose parts fit together well. It also saves effort; sometimes you can
make Lisp do a surprising amount of your work for you.

The aim of this chapter is to make a language which supports multiple
processes. Our strategy will be to turn Lisp into such a language, by
adding a few new operators. The basic elements of our language will be
as follows: Functions will be defined with the =defun or =lambda macros
from the previous chapter. Processes will be instantiated from function
calls. There is no limit on the number of active processes, or the
number of processes instantiated from any one function. Each process
will have a priority, initially given as an argument when it is created.
Wait expressions may occur within functions. A wait expression will take
a variable, a test expression, and a body of code. If a process
encounters a wait, the process will be suspended at that point until the
test expression returns true. Once the process restarts, the body of
code will be evaluated, with the variable bound to the value of the test
expression. Test expressions should not ordinarily have side-effects,
because there are no guarantees about when, or how often, they will be
evaluated. Scheduling will be done by priority. Of all the processes
able to restart, the system will run the one with the highest priority.
The default process will run if no other process can. It is a
read-eval-print loop. Creation and deletion of most objects will be
possible on the fly. From running processes it will be possible to
define new functions, and to instantiate and kill processes.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defstruct proc pri state wait)

    (proclaim '(special *procs* *proc*))

    (defvar *halt* (gensym))

    (defvar *default-proc*
      (make-proc :state #'(lambda (x)
                (format t "~%>> ")
                (princ (eval (read)))
                (pick-process))))

    (defmacro fork (expr pri)
      `(prog1 ',expr
         (push (make-proc
            :state #'(lambda (,(gensym))
                   ,expr
                   (pick-process))
            :pri ,pri)
           *procs*)))

    (defmacro program (name args &body body)
      `(=defun ,name ,args
           (setq *procs* nil)
           ,@body
           (catch *halt* (loop (pick-process)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 21.1: Process structure and instantiation.

<<IDX120>>

Continuations make it possible to store the state of a Lisp program.
Being able to store several states at once is not very far from having
multiple processes. Starting with the macros defined in the previous
chapter, we need less than 60 lines of code to implement multiple
processes.

<<Implementation>><<SEC132>>

** 21.2 Implementation
Figures 21.1 and 21.2 contain all the code needed to support multiple
processes. Figure 21.1 contains code for the basic data structures, the
default process, initialization, and instantiation of processes.
Processes, or procs, have the following structure:

- =pri= :: is the priority of the process, which should be a positive
  number.
- == :: state is a continuation representing the state of a suspended
  process. A process is restarted by funcalling its state.
- =wait= :: is usually a function which must return true in order for
  the process to be restarted, but initially the wait of a newly created
  process is nil. A process with a null wait can always be restarted.

The program uses three global variables: *procs*, the list of currently
suspended processes; *proc*, the process now running; and
*default-proc*, the default process.

The default process runs only when no other process can. It simulates
the Lisp toplevel. Within this loop, the user can halt the program, or
type expressions which enable suspended processes to restart. Notice
that the default process calls eval explicitly. This is one of the few
situations in which it is legitimate to do so. Generally it is not a
good idea to call eval at runtime, for two reasons:

1. It's inefficient: eval is handed a raw list, and either has to
   compile it on the spot, or evaluate it in an interpreter. Either way
   is slower than compiling the code beforehand, and just calling it.
2. It's less powerful, because the expression is evaluated with no
   lexical context. Among other things, this means that you can't refer
   to ordinary variables visible outside the expression being evaluated.

Usually, calling eval explicitly is like buying something in an airport
gift-shop. Having waited till the last moment, you have to pay high
prices for a limited selection of second-rate goods.

Cases like this are rare instances when neither of the two preceding
arguments applies. We couldn't possibly have compiled the expressions
beforehand. We are just now reading them; there is no beforehand.
Likewise, the expression can't refer to surrounding lexical variables,
because expressions typed at the toplevel are in the null lexical
environment. In fact, the definition of this function simply reflects
its English description: it reads and evaluates what the user types.

The macro fork instantiates a process from a function call. Functions
are defined as usual with =defun:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (=defun foo (x)
        (format t "Foo was called with ~A.~%" x)
        (=values (1+ x)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now when we call fork with a function call and a priority number:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (fork (foo 2) 25)
#+END_EXAMPLE

a new process is pushed onto *procs*. The new process has a priority of
25, a proc-wait of nil, since it hasn't been started yet, and a
proc-state consisting of a call to foo with the argument 2.

The macro program allows us to create a group of processes and run them
together. The definition:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (program two-foos (a b)
         (fork (foo a) 99)
         (fork (foo b) 99))
#+END_EXAMPLE

macroexpands into the two fork expressions, sandwiched between code
which clears out the suspended processes, and other code which
repeatedly chooses a process to run. Outside this loop, the macro
establishes a tag to which control can be thrown to end the program. As
a gensym, this tag will not conflict with tags established by user code.
A group of processes defined as a program returns no particular value,
and is only meant to be called from the toplevel.

After the processes are instantiated, the process scheduling code takes
over. This code is shown in Figure 21.2. The function pick-process
selects and runs the highest priority process which is able to restart.
Selecting this process is the job of most-urgent-process. A suspended
process is eligible to run if it has no wait function, or its wait
function returns true. Among eligible processes, the one with the
highest priority is chosen. The winning process and the value returned
by its wait function (if there is one) are returned to pick-process.
There will always be some winning process, because the default process
always wants to run.

The remainder of the code in Figure 21.2 defines the operators used to
switch control between processes. The standard wait expression is wait,
as used in the function pedestrian in Figure 21.3. In this example, the
process waits until there is something in the list *open-doors*, then
prints a message:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (ped)
    >> (push 'door2 *open-doors*)
    Entering DOOR2
    >> (halt)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

A wait is similar in spirit to an =bind (page 267), and carries the same
restriction that it must be the last thing to be evaluated. Anything we
want to happen after the wait must be put in its body. Thus, if we want
to have a process wait several times, the wait expressions must be
nested. By asserting facts aimed at one another, processes can cooperate
in reaching some goal, as in Figure 21.4.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun pick-process ()
      (multiple-value-bind (p val) (most-urgent-process)
        (setq *proc* p
          *procs* (delete p *procs*))
        (funcall (proc-state p) val)))

    (defun most-urgent-process ()
      (let ((proc1 *default-proc*) (max -1) (val1 t))
        (dolist (p *procs*)
          (let ((pri (proc-pri p)))
        (if (> pri max)
            (let ((val (or (not (proc-wait p))
                   (funcall (proc-wait p)))))
              (when val

    Approach DOOR1. Open DOOR1. Enter DOOR1. Close DOOR1.

#+END_EXAMPLE

There is another, simpler type of wait expression: yield, whose only
purpose is to give other higher-priority processes a chance to run. A
process might want to yield after executing a setpri expression, which
resets the priority of the current process. As with a wait, any code to
be executed after a yield must be put within its body.

The program in Figure 21.5 illustrates how the two operators work
together. Initially, the barbarians have two aims: to capture Rome and
to plunder it. Capturing the city has (slightly) higher priority, and so
will run first. However, after the city has been reduced, the priority
of the capture process decreases to 1. Then there is a vote, and
plunder, as the highest-priority process, starts running.

Only after the barbarians have looted Rome's palaces and ransomed the
patricians, does the capture process resume, and the barbarians turn to
fortifying their own position.

Underlying wait expressions is the more general arbitrator. This
function stores the current process, and then calls pick-process to
start some process (perhaps the same one) running again. It will be
given two arguments: a test function and a continuation. The former will
be stored as the proc-wait of the process being suspended, and called
later to determine if it can be restarted. The latter will become the
proc-state, and calling it will restart the suspended process.

#+END_EXAMPLE

<<IDX124>>

The macros wait and yield build this continuation function simply by
wrapping their bodies in lambda-expressions. For example,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (wait d (car *bboard*) (=values d))
#+END_EXAMPLE

expands into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (arbitrator #'(lambda () (car *bboard*))
            #'(lambda (d) (=values d)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If the code obeys the restrictions listed in Figure 20.5, making a
closure of the wait's body will preserve the whole current continuation.
With its =values expanded the second argument becomes: #'(lambda (d)
(funcall *cont* d)) Since the closure contains a reference to *cont*,
the suspended process with this wait function will have a handle on
where it was headed at the time it was suspended.

The halt operator stops the whole program, by throwing control back to
the tag established by the expansion of program. It takes an optional
argument, which will be returned as the value of the program. Because
the default process is always willing to run, the only way programs end
is by explicit halts. It doesn't matter what code follows a halt, since
it won't be evaluated.

Individual processes can be killed by calling kill. If given no
arguments, this operator kills the current process. In this case, kill
is like a wait expression which neglects to store the current process.
If kill is given arguments, they become the arguments to a delete on the
list of processes. In the current code, there is not much one can say in
a kill expression, because processes do not have many properties to
refer to. However, a more elaborate system would associate more
information with processes--time stamps, owners, and so on. The default
process can't be killed, because it isn't kept in the list *procs*.

<<The Less-than-Rapid Prototype>><<SEC133>>

** 21.3 The Less-than-Rapid Prototype
Processes simulated with continuations are not going to be nearly as
efficient as real operating system processes. What's the use, then, of
programs like the one in this chapter?

Such programs are useful in the same way that sketches are. In
exploratory programming or rapid prototyping, the program is not an end
in itself so much as a vehicle for working out one's ideas. In many
other fields, something which serves this purpose is called a sketch. An
architect could, in principle, design an entire building in his head.
However, most architects seem to think better with pencils in their
hands: the design of a building is usually worked out in a series of
preparatory sketches.

Rapid prototyping is sketching software. Like an architect's first
sketches, software prototypes tend to be drawn with a few sweeping
strokes. Considerations of cost and efficiency are ignored in an initial
push to develop an idea to the full. The result, at this stage, is
likely to be an unbuildable building or a hopelessly inefficient piece
of software. But the sketches are valuable all the same, because

1. They convey information briefly.
2. They offer a chance to experiment.

The program described in this chapter is, like those in succeeding
chapters, a sketch. It suggests the outlines of multiprocessing in a
few, broad strokes. And though it would not be efficient enough for use
in production software, it could be quite useful for experimenting with
other aspects of multiple processes, like scheduling algorithms.

Chapters 22--24 present other applications of continuations. None of
them is efficient enough for use in production software. Because Lisp
and rapid prototyping evolved together, Lisp includes a lot of features
specifically intended for prototypes: inefficient but convenient
features like property lists, keyword parameters, and, for that matter,
lists. Continuations probably belong in this category. They save more
state than a program is likely to need. So our continuation-based
implementation of Prolog, for example, is a good way to understand the
language, but an inefficient way to implement it.

This book is concerned more with the kinds of abstractions one can build
in Lisp than with efficiency issues. It's important to realize, though,
that Lisp is a language for writing production software as well as a
language for writing prototypes. If Lisp has a reputation for slowness,
it is largely because so many programmers stop with the prototype. It is
easy to write fast programs in Lisp. Unfortunately, it is very easy to
write slow ones. The initial version of a Lisp program can be like a
diamond: small, clear, and very expensive. There may be a great
temptation to leave it that way.

In other languages, once you succeed in the arduous task of getting your
program to work, it may already be acceptably efficient. If you tile a
floor with tiles the size of your thumbnail, you don't waste many.
Someone used to developing software on this principle may find it
difficult to overcome the idea that when a program works, it's finished.
"In Lisp you can write programs in no time at all," he may think, "but
boy, are they slow." In fact, neither is the case. You can get fast
programs, but you have to work for them. In this respect, using Lisp is
like living in a rich country instead of a poor one: it may seem
unfortunate that one has to work to stay thin, but surely this is better
than working to stay alive, and being thin as a matter of course.

In less abstract languages, you work for functionality. In Lisp you work
for speed. Fortunately, working for speed is easier: most programs only
have a few critical sections in which speed matters.

* 22. Nondeterminism
Programming languages save us from being swamped by a mass of detail.
Lisp is a good language because it handles so many details itself,
enabling programmers to make the most of their limited tolerance for
complexity. This chapter describes how macros can make Lisp handle
another important class of details: the details of transforming a
nondeterministic algorithm into a deterministic one.

This chapter is divided into five parts. The first explains what
nondeterminism is. The second describes a Scheme implementation of
nondeterministic choose and fail which uses continuations. The third
part presents Common Lisp versions of choose and fail which build upon
the continuation-passing macros of Chapter 20. The fourth part shows how
the cut operator can be understood independently of Prolog. The final
part suggests refinements of the original nondeterministic operators.

The nondeterministic choice operators defined in this chapter will be
used to write an ATN compiler in Chapter 23 and an embedded Prolog in
Chapter 24.

** 22.1 The Concept
A nondeterministic algorithm is one which relies on a certain sort of
supernatural foresight. Why talk about such algorithms whenwe don't have
access to computers with supernatural powers? Because a nondeterministic
algorithm can be simulated by a deterministic one. For purely functional
programs--that is, those with no side-effects--simulating nondeterminism
is particularly straightforward. In purely functional programs,
nondeterminism can be implemented by search with backtracking.

This chapter shows how to simulate nondeterminism in functional
programs. If we have a simulator for nondeterminism, we can expect it to
produce results whenever a truly nondeterministic machine would. In many
cases, writing a program which depends on supernatural insight to solve
a problem is easier than writing one which doesn't, so such a simulator
would be a good thing to have.

In this section we will define the class of powers that nondeterminism
allows us; the next section demonstrates their utility in some sample
programs. The examples in these first two sections are written in
Scheme. (Some differences between Scheme and Common Lisp are summarized
on page 259.)

A nondeterministic algorithm differs from a deterministic one because it
can use the two special operators choose and fail. Choose is a function
which takes a finite set and returns one element. To explain how choose
chooses, we must first introduce the concept of a computational future.

Here we will represent choose as a function choose which takes a list
and returns one element. For each element, there is a set of futures the
computation could have if that element were chosen. In the following
expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x (choose '(1 2 3))))
      (if (odd? x)
          (+ x 1)
        x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

there are three possible futures for the computation when it reaches the
point of the choose:

1. If choose returns 1, the computation will go through the then-clause
   of the if, and will return 2.
2. If choose returns 2, the computation will go through the else-clause
   of the if, and will return 2.
3. If choose returns 3, the computation will go through the then-clause
   of the if, and will return 4.

In this case, we know exactly what the future of the computation will be
as soon as we see what choose returns. In the general case, each choice
is associated with a set of possible futures, because within some
futures there could be additional chooses. For example, with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x (choose '(2 3))))
      (if (odd? x)
          (choose '(a b))
        x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

there are two sets of futures at the time of the first choose:

1. If choose returns 2, the computation will go through the else-clause
   of the if, and will return 2.
2. If choose returns 3, the computation will go through the then-clause
   of the if. At this point, the path of the computation splits into two
   possible futures, one in which a is returned, and one in which b is.

The first set has one future and the second set has two, so the
computation has three possible futures.

The point to remember is, if choose is given a choice of several
alternatives, each one is associated with a set of possible futures.
Which choice will it return?

We can assume that choose works as follows:

1. It will only return a choice for which some future does not contain a
   call to fail.
2. A choose over zero alternatives is equivalent to a fail.

So, for example, in

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x (choose '(1 2))))
      (if (odd? x)
          (fail)
        x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

each of the possible choices has exactly one future. Since the future
for a choice of 1 contains a call to fail, only 2 can be chosen. So the
expression as a whole is deterministic: it always returns 2.

However, the following expression is not deterministic:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x (choose '(1 2))))
      (if (odd? x)
          (let ((y (choose '(a b))))
        (if (eq? y 'a)
            (fail)
          y))
        x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

At the first choose, there are two possible futures for a choice of 1,
and one for a choice of 2. Within the former, though, the future is
really deterministic, because a choice of a would result in a call to
fail. So the expression as a whole could return either b or 2.

Finally, there is only one possible value for the expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x (choose '(1 2))))
      (if (odd? x)
          (choose '())
        x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

because if 1 is chosen, the future goes through a choose with no
choices. This example is thus equivalent to the last but one.

It may not be clear yet from the preceding examples, but we have just
got ourselves an abstraction of astounding power. In nondeterministic
algorithms we are allowed to say "choose an element such that nothing we
do later will result in a call to fail." For example, this is a
perfectly legitimate nondeterministic algorithm for discovering whether
you have a known ancestor called Igor:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Function Ig(n)
    if name(n) = `Igor'
    then return n
    else if parents(n)
    then return Ig(choose(parents(n)))
    else fail
#+END_EXAMPLE

The fail operator is used to influence the value returned by choose. If
we ever encounter a fail, choose would have chosen incorrectly. By
definition choose guesses correctly. So if we want to guarantee that the
computation will never pursue a certain path, all we need do is put a
fail somewhere in it, and that path will never be followed. Thus, as it
works recursively through generations of ancestors, the function Ig is
able to choose at each step a path which leads to an

Igor--to guess whether to follow the mother's or father's line.

It is as if a program can specify that choose pick some element from a
set of alternatives, use the value returned by choose for as long as it
wants, and then retroactively decide, by using fail as a veto, what it
wants choose to have picked. And, presto, it turns out that that's just
what choose did return. Hence the model in which choose has foresight.

In reality choose cannot have supernatural powers. Any implementation of
choose must simulate correct guessing by backtracking when it discovers
mistakes, like a rat finding its way through a maze. But all this
backtracking can be done beneath the surface. Once you have some form of
choose and fail, you get to write algorithms like the one above, as if
it really were possible to guess what ancestor to follow. By using
choose it is possible to write an algorithm to search some problem space
just by writing an algorithm to traverse it.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define (descent n1 n2)
      (if (eq? n1 n2)
          (list n2)
        (let ((p (try-paths (kids n1) n2)))
          (if p (cons n1 p) #f))))

    (define (try-paths ns n2)
      (if (null? ns)
          #f
        (or (descent (car ns) n2)
        (try-paths (cdr ns) n2))))

<<IDX126>>

<<Search (Nondeterminism)>><<SEC136>>

** 22.2 Search
Many classic problems can be formulated as search problems, and for such
problems nondeterminism often turns out to be a useful abstraction.
Suppose nodes is bound to a list of nodes in a tree, and (kids n) is a
function which returns the descendants of node n, or #f if there are
none. We want to write a function (descent n 1 n 2 ) which returns a
list of nodes on some path from n 1 to its descendant n 2 , if there is
one. Figure 22.1 shows a deterministic version of this function.

Nondeterminism allows the programmer to ignore the details of finding a
path. It's possible simply to tell choose to find a node n such that
there is a path from n to our destination. Using nondeterminism we can
write the simpler version of descent shown in Figure 22.2.

The version shown in Figure 22.2 does not explicitly search for a node
on the right path. It is written on the assumption that choose has
chosen an n with the desired properties. If we are used to looking at
deterministic programs, we may not perceive that choose has to work as
if it could guess what n would make it through the computation which
follows without failing.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define (two-numbers)
      (list (choose '(0 1 2 3 4 5))
        (choose '(0 1 2 3 4 5))))

    (define (parlor-trick sum)
      (let ((nums (two-numbers)))
        (if (= (apply + nums) sum)
        `(the sum of ,@nums)
          (fail))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 22.3: Choice in a subroutine.

<<IDX127>>

Perhaps a more convincing example of the power of choose is its ability
to guess what will happen even in calling functions. Figure 22.3
contains a pair of functions to guess two numbers which sum to a number
given by the caller. The first function, two-numbers,
nondeterministically chooses two numbers and returns them in a list.
When we call parlor-trick, it calls two-numbers for a list of two
integers. Note that, in making its choice, two-numbers doesn't have
access to the number entered by the user.

If the two numbers guessed by choose don't sum to the number entered by
the user, the computation fails. We can rely on choose having avoided
computational paths which fail, if there are any which don't. Thus we
can assume that if the caller gives a number in the right range, choose
will have guessed right, as indeed it does:[fn:33]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (parlor-trick 7)
    (THE SUM OF 2 5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

In simple searches, the built-in Common Lisp function find-if would do
just as well. Where is the advantage of nondeterministic choice? Why not
just iterate through the list of alternatives in search of the element
with the desired properties? The crucial difference between choose and
conventional iteration is that its extent with respect to fails is
unbounded. Nondeterministic choose can see arbitrarily far into the
future; if something is going to happen at any point in the future which
would have invalidated some guess choose might make, we can assume that
choose knows to avoid guessing it. As we saw in parlor-trick, the fail
operator works even after we return from the function in which the
choose occurs.

This kind of failure happens in the search done by Prolog, for example.
Nondeterminism is useful in Prolog because one of the central features
of this language is its ability to return answers to a query one at a
time. By following this course instead of returning all the valid
answers at once, Prolog can handle recursive rules which would otherwise
yield infinitely large sets of answers.

The initial reaction to descent may be like the initial reaction to a
merge sort: where does the work get done? As in a merge sort, the work
gets done implicitly, but it does get done. Section 22.3 describes an
implementation of choose in which all the code examples presented so far
are real running programs.

These examples show the value of nondeterminism as an abstraction. The
best programming language abstractions save not just typing, but
thought. In automata theory, some proofs are difficult even to conceive
of without relying on nondeterminism. A language which allows
nondeterminism may give programmers a similar advantage.

<<Scheme Implementation>><<SEC137>>

** 22.3 Scheme Implementation
This section explains how to use continuations to simulate
nondeterminism. Figure 22.4 contains Scheme implementations of choose
and fail. Beneath the surface, # choose and fail simulate nondeterminism
by backtracking. A backtracking search program must somehow store enough
information to pursue other alternatives if the chosen one fails. This
information is stored in the form of continuations on the global list
*paths*.

The function choose is passed a list of alternatives in choices. If
choices is empty, then choose calls fail, which sends the computation
back to the previous choose. If choices is (first . rest), choose first
pushes onto *paths* a continuation in which choose is called on rest,
then returns first.

The function fail is simpler: it just pops a continuation off *paths*
and calls it. If there aren't any saved paths left, then fail returns
the symbol . However, it won't do simply to return it as a function
ordinarily returns values, or it will be returned as the value of the
most recent choose. What we really want to do is return right to the
toplevel. We do this by binding cc to the continuation where fail is
defined, which presumably is the toplevel. By calling cc, fail can
return straight there.

The implementation in Figure 22.4 treats *paths* as a stack, always
failing back to the most recent choice point. This strategy, known as
chronological backtracking, results in depth-first search of the problem
space. The word "non-determinism" is often used as if it were synonymous
with the depth-first imple- mentation. Floyd's classic paper on
nondeterministic algorithms uses the term in # this sense, and this is
also the kind of nondeterminism we find in nondetermin- istic parsers
and in Prolog. However, it should be noted that the implementation given
in Figure 22.4 is not the only possible implementation, nor even a
correct one. In principle, choose ought to be able to choose an object
which meets any computable specification. But a program which used these
versions of choose and fail to search a graph might not terminate, if
the graph contained cycles.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define *paths* ())

    (define failsym '@)

    (define (choose choices)
      (if (null? choices)
          (fail)
        (call-with-current-continuation
         (lambda (cc)
           (set! *paths*
             (cons (lambda ()
                 (cc (choose (cdr choices))))
               *paths*))
           (car choices)))))

    (define fail)

    (call-with-current-continuation
     (lambda (cc)
       (set! fail
         (lambda ()
           (if (null? *paths*)
               (cc failsym)
             (let ((p1 (car *paths*)))
               (set! *paths* (cdr *paths*))
               (p1)))))))

In practice, nondeterminism usually means using a depth-first
implementation equivalent to the one in Figure 22.4, and leaving it to
the user to avoid loops in the search space. However, for readers who
are interested, the last section in this chapter describes how to
implement true choose and fail.

<<Common Lisp Implementation>><<SEC138>>

** 22.4 Common Lisp Implementation
This section describes how to write a form of choose and fail in Common
Lisp. As the previous section showed, call/cc makes it easy to simulate
nondeterminism in Scheme. Continuations provide the direct embodiment of
our theoretical concept of a computational future. In Common Lisp, we
can use instead the continuation-passing macros of Chapter 20. With
these macros we will be able to provide a form of choose slightly uglier
than the Scheme version presented in the previous section, but
equivalent in practice.

Figure 22.5 contains a Common Lisp implementation of fail, and two
versions of choose. The syntax of a Common Lisp choose is slightly
different from the Scheme version. The Scheme choose took one argument:
a list of choices from which to select a value. The Common Lisp version
has the syntax of a progn. It can be followed by any number of
expressions, from which it chooses one to evaluate:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (defun do2 (x)
    (choose (+ x 2) (* x 2) (expt x 2)))
    DO2
    > (do2 3)
    5
    > (fail)
    6
#+END_EXAMPLE

At the toplevel, we see more clearly the backtracking which underlies
nondeterministic search. The variable *paths* is used to store paths
which have not yet been followed. When the computation reaches a choose
expression with several alternatives, the first alternative is
evaluated, and the remaining choices are stored on *paths*. If the
program later on encounters a fail, the last stored choice will be
popped off *paths* and restarted. When there are no more paths left to
restart, fail returns a special value:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (fail)
    9
    > (fail)
#+END_EXAMPLE

In Figure 22.5 the constant failsym, which represents failure, is
defined to be the symbol . If you wanted to be able to have as an
ordinary return value, you could make failsym a gensym instead.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defparameter *paths* nil)

    (defconstant failsym '@)

    (defmacro choose (&rest choices)
      (if choices
          `(progn
         ,@(mapcar #'(lambda (c)
                `(push #'(lambda () ,c) *paths*))
                (reverse (cdr choices)))
         ,(car choices))
        '(fail)))

    (defmacro choose-bind (var choices &body body)
      `(cb #'(lambda (,var) ,@body) ,choices))

    (defun cb (fn choices)
      (if choices
          (progn
        (if (cdr choices)
            (push #'(lambda () (cb fn (cdr choices)))
              *paths*))
        (funcall fn (car choices)))
        (fail)))

    (defun fail ()
      (if *paths*
          (funcall (pop *paths*))
        failsym))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 22.5: Nondeterministic operators in Common Lisp.

<<IDX129>>

The other nondeterministic choice operator, choose-bind, has a slightly
different form. It should be given a symbol, a list of choices, and a
body of code. It will do a choose on the list of choices, bind the
symbol to the value chosen, and evaluate the body of code:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (choose-bind x '(marrakesh strasbourg vegas)
    (format nil "Let's go to ~A." x))
    "Let's go to MARRAKESH."
    > (fail)
    "Let's go to STRASBOURG."
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is only for convenience that the Common Lisp implementation provides
two choice operators. You could get the effect of choose from
choose-bind by always translating

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (choose (foo) (bar))
#+END_EXAMPLE

into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (choose-bind x '(1 2)
             (case x
               (1 (foo))
               (2 (bar))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

but programs are easier to read if we have a separate operator for this
case.[fn:34]

The Common Lisp choice operators store the bindings of relevant
variables using closures and variable capture. As macros, choose and
choose-bind get expanded within the lexical environment of the
containing expressions. Notice that what they push onto *paths* is a
closure over the choice to be saved, locking in all the bindings of the
lexical variables referred to within it. For example, in the expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x 2))
      (choose
       (+ x 1)
       (+ x 100)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

the value of x will be needed when the saved choices are restarted. This
is why choose is written to wrap its arguments in lambda-expressions.
The expression above gets macroexpanded into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((x 2))
      (progn
        (push #'(lambda () (+ x 100))
          *paths*)
        (+ x 1)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The object which gets stored on *paths* is a closure containing a
pointer to x. It is the need to preserve variables in closures which
dictates the difference between the syntax of the Scheme and Common Lisp
choice operators.

If we use choose and fail together with the continuation-passing macros
of Chapter 20, a pointer to our continuation variable *cont* will get
saved as well. By defining functions with =defun, calling them with
=bind, and having them return values with =values, we will be able to
use nondeterminism in any Common Lisp program.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (=defun two-numbers ()
        (choose-bind n1 '(0 1 2 3 4 5)
                 (choose-bind n2 '(0 1 2 3 4 5)
                      (=values n1 n2))))

    (=defun parlor-trick (sum)
        (=bind (n1 n2) (two-numbers)
               (if (= (+ n1 n2) sum)
               `(the sum of ,n1 ,n2)
             (fail))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 22.6: Common Lisp choice in a subroutine.

<<IDX130>>

With these macros, we can successfully run the example in which the
nondeterministic choice occurs in a subroutine. Figure 22.6 shows the
Common Lisp version of parlor-trick, which works as it did in Scheme:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (parlor-trick 7)
    (THE SUM OF 2 5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This works because the expression

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (=values n1 n2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

gets macroexpanded into

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (funcall *cont* n1 n2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

within the choose-binds. Each choose-bind is in turn macroexpanded into
a closure, which keeps pointers to all the variables referred to in the
body, including *cont*.

The restrictions on the use of choose, choose-bind, and fail are the
same as the restrictions given in Figure 20.5 for code which uses the
continuation-passing macros. Where a choice expression occurs, it must
be the last thing to be evaluated. Thus if we want to make sequential
choices, in Common Lisp the choices have to be nested:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (choose-bind first-name '(henry william)
    (choose-bind last-name '(james higgins)
    (=values (list first-name last-name))))
    (HENRY JAMES)
    > (fail)
    (HENRY HIGGINS)
    > (fail)
    (WILLIAM JAMES)
#+END_EXAMPLE

which will, as usual, result in depth-first search.

The operators defined in Chapter 20 claimed the right to be the last
expressions evaluated. This right is now preempted by the new layer of
macros; an =values expression should appear within a choose expression,
and not vice versa. That is,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (choose (=values 1) (=values 2))
#+END_EXAMPLE

will work, but

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (=values (choose 1 2))          ; wrong
#+END_EXAMPLE

will not. (In the latter case, the expansion of the choose would be
unable to capture the instance of *cont* in the expansion of the
=values.)

As long as we respect the restrictions outlined here and in Figure 20.5,
nondeterministic choice in Common Lisp will now work as it does in
Scheme. Figure 22.7 shows a Common Lisp version of the nondeterministic
tree search program given in Figure 22.2. The Common Lisp descent is a
direct translation, though it comes out slightly longer and uglier.

We now have Common Lisp utilities which make it possible to do
nondeterministic search without explicit backtracking. Having taken
trouble to write this code, we can reap the benefits by writing in very
few lines programs which would otherwise be large and messy. By building
another layer of macros on top of those presented here, we will be able
to write an ATN compiler in one page of code (Chapter 23), and a sketch
of Prolog in two (Chapter 24).

Common Lisp programs which use choose should be compiled with
tail-recursion optimization--not just to make them faster, but to avoid
running out of stack space. Programs which "return" values by calling
continuation functions never actually return until the final fail.
Without the optimization of tail-calls, the stack would just grow and
grow. #

<<Cuts>><<SEC139>>

** 22.5 Cuts
This section shows how to use cuts in Scheme programs which do
nondeterministic choice. Though the word cut comes from Prolog, the
concept belongs to nondeterminism generally. You might want to use cuts
in any program that made nondeterministic choices.

Cuts are easier to understand when considered independently of Prolog.
Let's imagine a real-life example. Suppose that the manufacturer of
Chocoblob candies decides to run a promotion. A small number of boxes of
Chocoblobs will also contain tokens entitling the recipient to valuable
prizes. To ensure fairness, no two of the winning boxes are sent to the
same city.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (=defun descent (n1 n2)
    (cond ((eq n1 n2) (=values (list n2)))
    ((kids n1) (choose-bind n (kids n1)
    (=bind (p) (descent n n2)
    (=values (cons n1 p)))))
    (t (fail))))
    DESCENT
    > (defun kids (n)
    (case n
    (a '(b c))
    (b '(d e))
    (c '(d f))
    (f '(g))))
    KIDS
    > (descent 'a 'g)
    (A C F G)
    > (fail)

    > (descent 'a 'd)
    (A B D)
    > (fail)
    (A C D)
    > (fail)

    > (descent 'a 'h)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 22.7: Nondeterministic search in Common Lis.

<<IDX131>>

After the promotion has begun, it emerges that the tokens are small
enough to be swallowed by children. Hounded by visions of lawsuits,
Chocoblob lawyers begin a frantic search for all the special boxes.
Within each city, there are multiple stores that sell Chocoblobs; within
each store, there are multiple boxes. But the lawyers may not have to
open every box: once they find a coin-containing box in a given city,
they do not have to search any of the other boxes in that city, because
each city has at most one special box. To realize this is to do a cut.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define (find-boxes)
      (set! *paths* ())
      (let ((city (choose '(la ny bos))))
        (newline)
        (let* ((store (choose '(1 2)))
           (box (choose '(1 2))))
          (let ((triple (list city store box)))
        (display triple)
        (if (coin? triple)
            (display 'c))
        (fail)))))

    (define (coin? x)
      (member x '((la 1 2) (ny 1 1) (bos 2 2))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 22.8: Exhaustive Chocoblob search.

<<IDX132>>

What's cut is a portion of the search tree. For Chocoblobs, the search
tree exists physically: the root node is at the company's head office;
the children of this node are the cities where the special boxes were
sent; the children of those nodes are the stores in each city; and the
children of each store represent the boxes in that store. When the
lawyers searching this tree find one of the boxes containing a coin,
they can prune off all the unexplored branches descending from the city
they're in now.

Cuts actually take two operations: you can do a cut when you know that
part of the search tree is useless, but first you have to mark the tree
at the point where it can be cut. In the Chocoblob example, common sense
tells us that the tree is marked as we enter each city. It's hard to
describe in abstract terms what a Prolog cut does, because the marks are
implicit. With an explicit mark operator, the effect of a cut will be
more easily understood.

Figure 22.8 shows a program that nondeterministically searches a smaller
version of the Chocoblob tree. As each box is opened, the program
displays a list of (city store box). If the box contains a coin, a c is
printed after it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (find-boxes)
    (LA 1 1)(LA 1 2)C(LA 2 1)(LA 2 2)
    (NY 1 1)C(NY 1 2)(NY 2 1)(NY 2 2)
    (BOS 1 1)(BOS 1 2)(BOS 2 1)(BOS 2 2)C
#+END_EXAMPLE

To implement the optimized search technique discovered by the Chocoblob
lawyers, we need two new operators: mark and cut. Figure 22.9 shows one
way to define them. Whereas nondeterminism itself can be understood
independently of any particular implementation, pruning the search tree
is an optimization technique, and depends very much on how choose is
implemented. The mark and cut defined in Figure 22.9 are suitable for
use with the depth-first implementation of choose (Figure 22.4).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define (mark) (set! *paths* (cons fail *paths*)))

    (define (cut)
      (cond ((null? *paths*))
        ((equal? (car *paths*) fail)
         (set! *paths* (cdr *paths*)))
        (else
         (set! *paths* (cdr *paths*))
         (cut))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

      (let ((city (choose '(la ny bos))))
        (mark)              ;
        (newline)
        (let* ((store (choose '(1 2)))
           (box (choose '(1 2))))
          (let ((triple (list city store box)))
        (display triple)
        (if (coin? triple)
            (begin (cut) (display 'c))) ;
        (fail)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 22.10: Pruned Chocoblob search.

<<IDX134>>

The general idea is for mark to store markers in *paths*,the list of
unexplored choice-points. Calling cut pops *paths* all the way down to
the most recent marker. What should we use as a marker? We could use
e.g. the symbol m, but that would require us to rewrite fail to ignore
the ms when it encountered them. Fortunately, since functions are data
objects too, there is at least one marker that will allow us to use fail
as is: the function fail itself. Then if fail happens on a marker, it
will just call itself.

Figure 22.10 shows how these operators would be used to prune the search
tree in the Chocoblob case. (Changed lines are indicated by semicolons.)
We call mark upon choosing a city. At this point, *paths* contains one
continuation, representing the search of the remaining cities.

Figure 22.11: A directed graph with a loop.

<<IDX135>>

If we find a box with a coin in it, we call cut, which sets *paths* back
to the value it had at the time of the mark. The effects of the cut are
not visible until the next call to fail. But when it comes, after the
display, the next fail sends the search all the way up to the topmost
choose, even if there would otherwise have been live choice-points lower
in the search tree. The upshot is, as soon as we find a box with a coin
in it, we resume the search at the next city:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (find-boxes)
    (LA 1 1)(LA 1 2)C
    (NY 1 1)C
    (BOS 1 1)(BOS 1 2)(BOS 2 1)(BOS 2 2)C
#+END_EXAMPLE

In this case, we open seven boxes instead of twelve.

<<True Nondeterminism>><<SEC140>>

** 22.6 True Nondeterminism
A deterministic graph-searching program would have to take explicit
steps to avoid getting caught in a circular path. Figure 22.11 shows a
directed graph containing a loop. A program searching for a path from
node a to node e risks getting caught in the circular path #a, b, c#.
Unless a deterministic searcher used randomization, breadth-first
search, or checked explicitly for circular paths, the search might never
terminate. The implementation of path shown in Figure 22.12 avoids
circular paths by searching breadth-first.

In principle, nondeterminism should save us the trouble of even
considering circular paths. The depth-first implementation of choose and
fail given in Section 22.3 is vulnerable to the problem of circular
paths, but if we were being picky, we would expect nondeterministic
choose to be able to select an object which meets any computable
specification, and this case is no exception. Using a correct choose, we
should be able to write the shorter and clearer version of path shown in
Figure 22.13.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define (path node1 node2)
      (bf-path node2 (list (list node1))))

    (define (bf-path dest queue)
      (if (null? queue)
          '
        (let* ((path (car queue))
           (node (car path)))
          (if (eq? node dest)
          (cdr (reverse path))
        (bf-path dest
             (append (cdr queue)
                 (map (lambda (n)
                    (cons n path))
                      (neighbors node))))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

        ((memq node2 (neighbors node1)) (list node2))
        (else (let ((n (true-choose (neighbors node1))))
            (cons n (path n node2))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 22.13: Nondeterministic search.

<<IDX137>>

This section shows how to implement versions choose and fail which are
safe even from circular paths. Figure 22.14 contains a Scheme
implementation of true nondeterministic choose and fail. Programs which
use these versions of choose # and fail should find solutions whenever
the equivalent nondeterministic algorithms would, subject to hardware
limitations.

The implementation of true-choose defined in Figure 22.14 works by
treating the list of stored paths as a queue. Programs using true-choose
will search their state-space breadth-first. When the program reaches a
choice-point, continuations to follow each choice are appended to the
end of the list of stored paths.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (define *paths* ())

    (define failsym '@)

    (define (true-choose choices)
      (call-with-current-continuation
       (lambda (cc)
         (set! *paths* (append *paths*
                   (map (lambda (choice)
                      (lambda () (cc choice)))
                    choices)))
         (fail))))

    (define fail)

    (call-with-current-continuation
     (lambda (cc)
       (set! fail
         (lambda ()
           (if (null? *paths*)
               (cc failsym)
             (let ((p1 (car *paths*)))
               (set! *paths* (cdr *paths*))
               (p1)))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 22.14: Correct choose in Scheme.

<<IDX138>>

(Scheme's map returns the same values as Common Lisp's mapcar.) After
this there is a call to fail, which is unchanged.

This version of choose would allow the implementation of path defined in
Figure 22.13 to find a path--indeed, the shortest path--from a to e in
the graph displayed in Figure 22.11.

Although for the sake of completeness this chapter has provided correct
versions of choose and fail, the original implementations will usually
suffice. The value of a programming language abstraction is not
diminished just because its implementation isn't formally correct. In
some languages we act as if we had access to all the integers, even
though the largest one may be only 32767. As long as we know how far we
can push the illusion, there is little danger to it--- little enough, at
least, to make the abstraction a bargain. The conciseness of the
programs presented in the next two chapters is due largely to their use
of nondeterministic choose and fail.

* 23. Parsing with ATNs
This chapter shows how to write a nondeterministic parser as an embedded
language. The first part explains what ATN parsers are, and how they
represent grammar rules. The second part presents an ATN compiler which
uses the nondeterministic operators defined in the previous chapter. The
final sections present a small ATN grammar, and show it in action
parsing sample input.

** 23.1 Background
Augmented Transition Networks, or ATNs, are a form of parser described
by Bill Woods in 1970. Since then they have become a widely used
formalism for # parsing natural language. In an hour you can write an
ATN grammar which parses interesting English sentences. For this reason,
people are often held in a sort of spell when they first encounter them.

In the 1970s, some people thought that ATNs might one day be components
of truly intelligent-seeming programs. Though few hold this position
today, ATNs have found a niche. They aren't as good as you are at
parsing English, but they can still parse an impressive variety of
sentences.

ATNs are useful if you observe the following four restrictions:

1. Use them in a semantically limited domain--in a front-end to a
   particular database, for example.
2. Don't feed them very difficult input. Among other things, don't
   expect them to understand wildly ungrammatical sentences the way
   people can.
3. Only use them for English, or other languages in which word order
   determines grammatical structure. ATNs would not be useful in parsing
   inflected languages like Latin.
4. Don't expect them to work all the time. Use them in applications
   where it's helpful if they work ninety percent of the time, not those
   where it's critical that they work a hundred percent of the time.

Within these limits there are plenty of useful applications. The
canonical example is as the front-end of a database. If you attach an
ATN-driven interface to such a system, then instead of making a formal
query, users can ask questions in a constrained form of English.

<<The Formalism>><<SEC143>>

** 23.2 The Formalism
To understand what ATNs do, we should recall their full name: augmented
transition networks. A transition network is a set of nodes joined
together by directed arcs--essentially, a flow-chart. One node is
designated the start node, and some other nodes are designated terminal
nodes. Conditions are attached to each arc, which have to be met before
the arc can be followed. There will be an input sentence, with a pointer
to the current word. Following some arcs will cause the pointer to be
advanced. To parse a sentence on a transition network is to find a path
from the start node to some terminal node, along which all the
conditions can be met.

ATNs add two features to this model:

1. ATNs have registers--named slots for storing away information as the
   parse proceeds. As well as performing tests, arcs can modify the
   contents of the registers.
2. ATNs are recursive. Arcs may require that, in order to follow them,
   the parse must successfully make it through some sub-network.

Terminal nodes use the information which has accumulated in the
registers to build list structures, which they return in much the same
way that functions return values. In fact, with the exception of being
nondeterministic, ATNs behave a lot like a functional programming
language.

The ATN defined in Figure 23.1 is nearly the simplest possible. It
parses noun-verb sentences of the form "Spot runs." The network
representation of this ATN is shown in Figure 23.2.

What does this ATN do when given the input (spot runs)? The first node
has one outgoing arc, a cat, or category arc, leading to node s2. It
says, effectively, you can follow me if the current word is a noun, and
if you do, you must store the current word (indicated by *) in the subj
register. So we leave this node with spot stored in the subj register.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defnode s
      (cat noun s2
           (setr subj *)))

    (defnode s2
      (cat verb s3
           (setr v *)))

    (defnode s3
      (up `(sentence
        (subject ,(getr subj))
        (verb ,(getr v)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 23.1: A very small ATN.

<<IDX139>>

Figure 23.2: Graph of a small ATN.

<<IDX140>>

There is always a pointer to the current word. Initially it points to
the first word in the sentence. When cat arcs are followed, this pointer
is moved forward one. So when we get to node s2, the current word is the
second, runs. The second arc is just like the first, except that it is
looking for a verb. It finds runs, stores it in register v, and proceeds
to s3.

The final node, s3, has only a pop, or terminal, arc. (Nodes with pop
arcs have dashed borders.) Because we arrive at the pop arc just as we
run out of input, we have a successful parse. The pop arc returns the
backquoted expression within it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (sentence (subject spot)
          (verb runs))
#+END_EXAMPLE

An ATN corresponds to the grammar of the language it is designed to
parse. A decent-sized ATN for parsing English will have a main network
for parsing sentences, and sub-networks for parsing noun-phrases,
prepositional phrases, modifier groups, and so on. The need for
recursion is obvious when we consider that noun-phrases may contain
prepositional phrases which may contain noun-phrases, ad infinitum, as
in "the key on the table in the hall of the house on the hill"

<<Nondeterminism (Parsing with ATNs)>><<SEC144>>

** 23.3 Nondeterminism
Although we didn't see it in this small example, ATNs are
nondeterministic. A node can have several outgoing arcs, more than one
of which could be followed with a given input. For example, a reasonably
good ATN should be able to parse both imperative and declarative
sentences. Thus the first node could have outgoing cat arcs for both
nouns (in statements) and verbs (in commands).

What if the first word of the sentence is "time," which is both a noun
and a verb? How does the parser know which arc to follow? When ATNs are
described as nondeterministic, it means that users can assume that the
parser will correctly guess which arc to follow. If some arcs lead only
to failed parses, they won't be followed.

In reality the parser cannot look into the future. It simulates correct
guessing by backtracking when it runs out of arcs, or input. But all the
machinery of backtracking is inserted automatically into the code
generated by the ATN compiler. We can write ATNs as if the parser really
could guess which arcs to follow.

Like many (perhaps most) programs which use nondeterminism, ATNs use the
depth-first implementation. Experience parsing English quickly teaches
one that any given sentence has a slew of legal parsings, most of them
junk. On a conventional single-processor machine, one is better off
trying to get good parses quickly. Instead of getting all the parses at
once, we get just the most likely. If it has a reasonable
interpretation, then we have saved the effort of finding other parses;
if not, we can call fail to get more.

To control the order in which parses are generated, the programmer needs
to have some way of controlling the order in which choose tries
alternatives. The depth-first implementation isn't the only way of
controlling the order of the search. Any implementation except a
randomizing one imposes some kind of order. However, ATNs, like Prolog,
have the depth-first implementation conceptually built-in. In an ATN,
the arcs leaving a node are tried in the order in which they were
defined. This convention allows the programmer to order arcs by
priority.

<<An ATN Compiler>><<SEC145>>

** 23.4 An ATN Compiler
Ordinarily, an ATN-based parser needs three components: the ATN itself,
an interpreter for traversing it, and a dictionary which can tell it,
for example, that "runs" is a verb. Dictionaries are a separate
topic--here we will use a rudimentary handmade one. Nor will we need to
deal with a network interpreter, because we will translate the ATN
directly into Lisp code. The program described here is called an

ATN compiler because it transforms a whole ATN into code. Nodes are
transformed into functions, and arcs become blocks of code within them.

Chapter 6 introduced the use of functions as a form of representation.
This practice usually makes programs faster. Here it means that there
will be no overhead of interpreting the network at runtime. The
disadvantage is that there is less to inspect when something goes wrong,
especially if you're using a Common Lisp implementation which doesn't
provide function-lambda-expression.

Figure 23.3 contains all the code for transforming ATN nodes into Lisp
code. The macro defnode is used to define nodes. It generates little
code itself, just a choose over the expressions generated for each of
the arcs. The two parameters of a node-function get the following
values: pos is the current input pointer (an integer), and regs is the
current set of registers (a list of assoc-lists).

The macro defnode defines a macro with the same name as the
corresponding node. Node s will be defined as macro s. This convention
enables arcs to know how to refer to their destination nodes--they just
call the macro with that name. It also means that you shouldn't give
nodes the names of existing functions or macros, or these will be
redefined.

Debugging ATNs requires some sort of trace facility. Because nodes
become functions, we don't have to write our own. We can use the
built-in Lisp function trace. As mentioned on page 266, using =defun to
define nodes means that we can trace parses going through node mods by
saying (trace =mods).

The arcs within the body of a node are simply macro calls, returning
code which gets embedded in the node function being made by defnode. The
parser uses nondeterminism at each node by executing a choose over the
code representing each of the arcs leaving that node. A node with
several outgoing arcs, say

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defnode foo
      <arc 1>
      <arc 2>)
#+END_EXAMPLE

gets translated into a function definition of the following form:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (=defun foo (pos regs)
        (choose
         <translation of arc 1>
         <translation of arc 2>))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro defnode (name &rest arcs)
      `(=defun ,name (pos regs) (choose ,@arcs)))

          (,next pos ,(compile-cmds cmds))))

    (defmacro cat (cat next &rest cmds)
      `(if (= (length *sent*) pos)
           (fail)

Figure 23.4: Macroexpansion of a node function.

<<IDX142>>

Figure 23.4 shows the macroexpansion of the first node in the sample ATN
of Figure 23.11. When called at runtime, node functions like s
nondeterministically choose an arc to follow. The parameter pos will be
the current position in the input sentence, and regs the current
registers.

Cat arcs, as we saw in our original example, insist that the current
word of input belong to a certain grammatical category. Within the body
of a cat arc, the symbol * will be bound to the current word of input.

Push arcs, defined with down, require successful calls to sub-networks.
They take two destination nodes, the sub-network destination sub, and
the next node in the current network, next. Notice that whereas the code
generated for a cat arc simply calls the next node in the network, the
code generated for a push arc uses =bind. The push arc must successfully
return from the sub-network before continuing on to the node which
follows it. A clean set of registers (nil) gets consed onto the front of
regs before they are passed to the sub-network. In the bodies of other
types of arcs, the symbol * will be bound to the current word of input,
but in push arcs it will be bound to the expression returned by the
sub-network.

Jump arcs are like short-circuits. The parser skips right across to the
destination node--no tests are required, and the input pointer isn't
advanced.

The final type of arc is the pop arc, defined with up. Pop arcs are
unusual in that they don't have a destination. Just as a Lisp return
leads not to a subroutine but the calling function, a pop arc leads not
to a new node but back to the "calling" push arc. The =values in a pop
arc "returns" a value to the =bind in the most recent push arc. But, as
Section 20.2 explained, what's happening is not a normal Lisp return:
the body of the =bind has been wrapped up into a continuation and passed
down as a parameter through any number of arcs, until the =values of the
pop arc finally calls it on the "return" values.

Chapter 22 described two versions of nondeterministic choose: a fast
choose (page 293) that wasn't guaranteed to terminate when there were
loops in the search space, and a slower true-choose (page 304) which was
safe from such loops. There can be cycles in an ATN, of course, but as
long as at least one arc in each cycle advances the input pointer, the
parser will eventually run off the end of the sentence. The problem
arises with cycles which don't advance the input pointer. Here we have
two alternatives:

1. Use the slower, correct nondeterministic choice operator (the
   depth-first version given on page 396).
2. Use the fast choose, and specify that it is an error to define
   networks

containing cycles which could be traversed by following just jump arcs.
The code defined in Figure 23.3 takes the second approach.

The last four definitions in Figure 23.3 define the macros used to read
and set registers within arc bodies. In this program, register sets are
represented as assoc-lists. An ATN deals not with sets of registers, but
sets of sets of registers. When the parser moves down to a sub-network,
it gets a clean set of registers pushed on top of the existing ones.
Thus the whole collection of registers, at any given time, is a list of
assoc-lists.

The predefined register operators work on the current, or topmost, set
of registers: getr reads a register; setr sets one; and pushr pushes a
value into one. Both # getr and pushr use the primitive register
manipulation macro set-register. Note that registers don't have to be
declared. If set-register is sent a certain name, it will create a
register with that name.

The register operators are all completely nondestructive. Cons, cons,
cons, says set-register. This makes them slow and generates a lot of
garbage, but, as explained on page 261, objects used in a part of a
program where continuations are made should not be destructively
modified. An object in one thread of control may be shared by another
thread which is currently suspended. In this case, the registers found
in one parse will share structure with the registers in many of the
other parses. If speed became an issue, we could store registers in
vectors instead of assoc-lists, and recycle used vectors into a common
pool.

Push, cat, and jump arcs can all contain bodies of expressions.
Ordinarily these will be just setrs. By calling compile-cmdson their
bodies, the expansion functions of these arc types string a series of
setrs into a single expression:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (compile-cmds '((setr a b) (setr c d)))
    (SETR A B (SETR C D REGS))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Each expression has the next expression inserted as its last argument,
except the last, which gets regs. So a series of expressions in the body
of an arc will be transformed into a single expression returning the new
registers.

This approach allows users to insert arbitrary Lisp code into the bodies
of arcs by wrapping it in a progn. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (compile-cmds '((setr a b)
    (progn (princ "ek!"))
    (setr c d)))
    (SETR A B (PROGN (PRINC "ek!") (SETR C D REGS)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Certain variables are left visible to code occurring in arc bodies. The
sentence will be in the global *sent*. Two lexical variables will also
be visible: pos, containing the current input pointer, and regs,
containing the current registers. This is another example of intentional
variable capture. If it were desirable to prevent the user from
referring to these variables, they could be replaced with gensyms.

The macro with-parses,defined in Figure 23.5, gives us a way of invoking
an ATN. It should be called with the name of a start node, an expression
to be parsed, and a body of code describing what to do with the returned
parses. The body of code within a with-parses expression will be
evaluated once for each successful parse. Within the body, the symbol
parse will be bound to the current parse. Superficially with-parses
resembles operators like dolist, but underneath it uses backtracking
search instead of simple iteration. A with-parses expression will return
@, because that's what fail returns when it runs out of choices.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-parses (node sent &body body)
      (with-gensyms (pos regs)
            `(progn
               (setq *sent* ,sent)
               (setq *paths* nil)
               (=bind (parse ,pos ,regs) (,node 0 '(nil))
                  (if (= ,pos (length *sent*))
                      (progn ,@body (fail))
                    (fail))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 23.5: Toplevel macro.

<<IDX143>>

Before going on to look at a more representative ATN, let's look at a
parsing generated from the tiny ATN defined earlier. The ATN compiler
(Figure 23.3) generates code which calls types to determine the
grammatical roles of a word, so first we have to give it some
definition:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun types (w)
      (cdr (assoc w '((spot noun) (runs verb)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now we just call with-parses with the name of the start node as the
first argument:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-parses s '(spot runs)
    (format t "Parsing: ~A~%" parse))
    Parsing: (SENTENCE (SUBJECT SPOT) (VERB RUNS))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<A Sample ATN>><<SEC146>>

** 23.5 A Sample ATN
Now that the whole ATN compiler has been described, we can go on to try
out some parses using a sample network. In order to make an ATN parser
handle a richer variety of sentences, you make the ATNs themselves more
complicated, not the ATN compiler. The compiler presented here is a toy
mainly in the sense that it's slow, not in the sense of having limited
power.

The power (as distinct from speed) of a parser is in the grammar, and
here limited space really will force us to use a toy version. Figures
23.8 through 23.11 define the ATN (or set of ATNs) represented in Figure
23.6. This network is just big enough to yield several parsings for the
classic parser fodder "Time flies like an arrow."

Figure 23.6: Graph of a larger ATN.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun types (word)
      (case word
        ((do does did) '(aux v))
        ((time times) '(n v))
        ((fly flies) '(n v))
        ((like) '(v prep))
        ((liked likes) '(v))
        ((a an the) '(det))
        ((arrow arrows) '(n))
        ((i you he she him her it) '(pron))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 23.7: Nominal dictionary.


We need a slightly larger dictionary to parse more complex input. The
function types (Figure 23.7) provides a dictionary of the most primitive
sort. It defines a 22-word vocabulary, and associates each word with a
list of one or more simple grammatical roles.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defnode mods
      (cat n mods/n
           (setr mods *)))

    (defnode mods/n
      (cat n mods/n
           (pushr mods *))
      (up `(n-group ,(getr mods))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 23.8: Sub-network for strings of modifiers.


The components of an ATN are themselves ATNs. The smallest ATN in our
set is the one in Figure 23.8. It parses strings of modifiers, which in
this case means just strings of nouns. The first node, mods, accepts a
noun. The second node, mods/n, can either look for more nouns, or return
a parsing.

Section 3.4 explained how writing programs in a functional style makes
them easier to test:

1. In a functional program, components can be tested individually.
2. In Lisp, functions can be tested interactively, in the toplevel loop.

Together these two principles allow interactive development: when we
write functional programs in Lisp, we can test each piece as we write
it.

ATNs are so like functional programs--in this implementation, they
macroexpand into functional programs--that the possibility of
interactive development applies to them as well. We can test an ATN
starting from any node, simply by giving its name as the first argument
to with-parses:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-parses mods '(time arrow)
    (format t "Parsing: ~A~%" parse))
    Parsing: (N-GROUP (ARROW TIME))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The next two networks have to be discussed together,because they are
mutually recursive. The network defined in Figure 23.9, which begins
with the node np, is used to parse noun phrases. The network defined in
Figure 23.10 parses prepositional phrases. Noun phrases may contain
prepositional phrases and vice versa, so the two networks each contain a
push arc which calls the other.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defnode np
      (cat det np/det
           (setr det *))
      (jump np/det
        (setr det nil))
      (cat pron pron
           (setr n *)))

    (defnode pron
      (up `(np (pronoun ,(getr n)))))

    (defnode np/det
      (down mods np/mods
        (setr mods *))
      (jump np/mods
        (setr mods nil)))

    (defnode np/mods
      (cat n np/n
           (setr n *)))

    (defnode np/n
      (up `(np (det ,(getr det))
           (modifiers ,(getr mods))
           (noun ,(getr n))))
      (down pp np/pp
        (setr pp *)))

    (defnode np/pp
      (up `(np (det ,(getr det))
           (modifiers ,(getr mods))
           (noun ,(getr n))
           ,(getr pp))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 23.9: Noun phrase sub-network.


The noun phrase network contains six nodes. The first node, np has three
choices. If it reads a pronoun, then it can move to node pron, which
pops out of the network:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-parses np '(it)
    (format t "Parsing: ~A~%" parse))
    Parsing: (NP (PRONOUN IT))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defnode pp
      (cat prep pp/prep
           (setr prep *)))

    (defnode pp/prep
      (down np pp/np
        (setr op *)))

    (defnode pp/np
      (up `(pp (prep ,(getr prep))
           (obj ,(getr op)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 23.10: Prepositional phrase sub-network.


Both the other arcs lead to node np/det: one arc reads a determiner
(e.g. "the"), and the other arc simply jumps, reading no input. At node
np/det, both arcs lead to np/mods; np/det has the option of pushing to
sub-network mods to pick up a string of modifiers, or jumping. Node
np-mods reads a noun and continues to np/n. This node can either pop a
result, or push to the prepositional phrase network to try to pick up a
prepositional phrase. The final node, np/pp, pops a result.

Different types of noun phrases will have different parse paths. Here
are two parsings on the noun phrase network:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-parses np '(arrows)
    (pprint parse))
    (NP (DET NIL)
    (MODIFIERS NIL)
    (NOUN ARROWS))

    > (with-parses np '(a time fly like him)
    (pprint parse))
    (NP (DET A)
    (MODIFIERS (N-GROUP TIME))
    (NOUN FLY)
    (PP (PREP LIKE)
    (OBJ (NP (PRONOUN HIM)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The first parse succeeds by jumping to np/det, jumping again to np/mods,
reading a noun, then popping at np/n. The second never jumps, pushing
first for a string of modifiers, and again for a prepositional phrase.
As is often the case with parsers, expressions which are syntactically
well-formed are such nonsense semantically that it's difficult for
humans even to detect the syntactic structure. Here the noun phrase "a
time fly like him" has the same form as "a Lisp hacker like him."

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defnode s
      (down np s/subj
        (setr mood 'decl)
        (setr subj *))
      (cat v v
           (setr mood 'imp)
           (setr subj '(np (pron you)))
           (setr aux nil)
           (setr v *)))

    (defnode s/subj
      (cat v v
           (setr aux nil)
           (setr v *)))

    (defnode v
      (up `(s (mood ,(getr mood))
          (subj ,(getr subj))
          (vcl (aux ,(getr aux))
               (v ,(getr v)))))
      (down np s/obj
        (setr obj *)))

    (defnode s/obj
      (up `(s (mood ,(getr mood))
          (subj ,(getr subj))
          (vcl (aux ,(getr aux))
               (v ,(getr v)))
          (obj ,(getr obj)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 23.11: Sentence network.


Now all we need is a network for recognizing sentence structure. The
network shown in Figure 23.11 parses both commands and statements. The
start node is conventionally called s. The first node leaving it pushes
for a noun phrase, which will be the subject of the sentence. The second
outgoing arc reads a verb. When a sentence is syntactically ambiguous,
both arcs could succeed, ultimately yielding two or more parsings, as in
Figure 23.12. The first parsing is analogous to "Island nations like a
navy," and the second is analogous to "Find someone like a policeman."
More complex ATNs are able to find six or more parsings for "Time flies
like an arrow."

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-parses s '(time flies like an arrow)
    (pprint parse))
    (S (MOOD DECL)
    (SUBJ (NP (DET NIL)
    (MODIFIERS (N-GROUP TIME))
    (NOUN FLIES)))
    (VCL (AUX NIL)
    (V LIKE))
    (OBJ (NP (DET AN)
    (MODIFIERS NIL)
    (NOUN ARROW))))
    (S (MOOD IMP)
    (SUBJ (NP (PRON YOU)))
    (VCL (AUX NIL)
    (V TIME))
    (OBJ (NP (DET NIL)
    (MODIFIERS NIL)
    (NOUN FLIES)
    (PP (PREP LIKE)
    (OBJ (NP (DET AN)
    (MODIFIERS NIL)
    (NOUN ARROW)))))))

The ATN compiler in this chapter is presented more as a distillation of
the idea of an ATN than as production software. A few obvious changes
would make this code much more efficient. When speed is important, the
whole idea of simulating nondeterminism with closures may be too slow.
But when it isn't essential, the programming techniques described here
lead to very concise programs.

* 24. Prolog
This chapter describes how to write Prolog as an embedded language.
Chapter 19 showed how to write a program which answered complex queries
on databases. Here we add one new ingredient: rules, which make it
possible to infer facts from those already known. A set of rules defines
a tree of implications. In order to use rules which would otherwise
imply an unlimited number of facts, we will search this implication tree
nondeterministically.

Prolog makes an excellent example of an embedded language. It combines
three ingredients: pattern-matching, nondeterminism, and rules. Chapters
18 and 22 give us the first two independently. By building Prolog on top
of the pattern-matching and nondeterministic choice operators we have
already, we will have an example of a real, multi-layer bottom-up
system. Figure 24.1 shows the layers of abstraction involved.

The secondary aim of this chapter is to study Prolog itself. For
experienced programmers, the most convenient explanation of Prolog may
be a sketch of its implementation. Writing Prolog in Lisp is
particularly interesting, because it brings out the similarities between
the two languages.

** 24.1 Concepts
Chapter 19 showed how to write a database system which would accept
complex queries containing variables, and generate all the bindings
which made the query true in the database. In the following example,
(after calling clear-db) we assert two facts and then query the
database:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (fact painter reynolds)
    (REYNOLDS)
    > (fact painter gainsborough)
    (GAINSBOROUGH)
    > (with-answer (painter ?x)
    (print ?x))
    GAINSBOROUGH
    REYNOLDS
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 24.1: Layers of abstraction.


Conceptually, Prolog is the database program with the addition of rules,
which make it possible to satisfy a query not just by looking it up in
the database, but by inferring it from other known facts. For example,
if we have a rule like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    If (hungry ?x) and (smells-of ?x turpentine)
    Then (painter ?x)
#+END_EXAMPLE

then the query (painter ?x) will be satisfied for ?x = raoul when the
database contains both (hungry raoul) and (smells-of raoul turpentine),
even if it doesn't contain (painter raoul).

In Prolog, the if-part of a rule is called the body, and the then-part
the head. (In logic, the names are antecedent and consequent, but it is
just as well to have separate names, to emphasize that Prolog inference
is not the same as logical implication.) When trying to establish
bindings[fn:35] for a query, the program looks first at the
head of a rule. If the head matches the query that the program is trying
to answer, the program will then try to establish bindings for the body
of the rule. Bindings which satisfy the body will, by definition,
satisfy the head.

The facts used in the body of the rule may in turn be inferred from
other rules:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    If (gaunt ?x) or (eats-ravenously ?x)
    Then (hungry ?x)
    and rules may be recursive, as in:
    If (surname ?f ?n) and (father ?f ?c)
    Then (surname ?c ?n)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Prolog will be able to establish bindings for a query if it can find
some path through the rules which leads eventually to known facts. So it
is essentially a search engine: it traverses the tree of logical
implications formed by the rules, looking for a successful path.

Though rules and facts sound like distinct types of objects, they are
conceptually interchangeable. Rules can be seen as virtual facts. If we
want our database to reflect the discovery that big, fierce animals are
rare, we could look for all the x such that there are facts (species x),
(big x), and (fierce x), and add a new fact (rare x). However, by
defining a rule to say

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    If (species ?x) and (big ?x) and (fierce ?x)
    Then (rare ?x)
#+END_EXAMPLE

we get the same effect, without actually having to add all the (rare x)
to the database. We can even define rules which imply an infinite number
of facts. Thus rules make the database smaller at the expense of extra
processing when it comes time to answer questions.

Facts, meanwhile, are a degenerate case of rules. The effect of any fact
F could be duplicated by a rule whose body was always true:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    If true
    Then F
#+END_EXAMPLE

To simplify our implementation, we will take advantage of this principle
and represent facts as bodyless rules. #

** 24.2 An Interpreter
Section 18.4 showed two ways to define if-match. The first was simple
but inefficient. Its successor was faster because it did much of its
work at compile-time. We will follow a similar strategy here. In order
to introduce some of the topics involved, we will begin with a simple
interpreter. Later we will show how to write the same program much more
efficiently.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-inference (query &body body)
      `(progn
         (setq *paths* nil)
         (=bind (binds) (prove-query ',(rep_ query) nil)
            (let ,(mapcar #'(lambda (v)
                      `(,v (fullbind ',v binds)))
                  (vars-in query #'atom))
              ,@body
              (fail)))))

    (defun rep_ (x)
      (if (atom x)
          (if (eq x '_) (gensym "?") x)
        (cons (rep_ (car x)) (rep_ (cdr x)))))

    (defun fullbind (x b)
      (cond ((varsym? x) (aif2 (binding x b)
                   (fullbind it b)
                   (gensym)))
        ((atom x) x)
        (t (cons (fullbind (car x) b)
             (fullbind (cdr x) b)))))

    (defun varsym? (x)
      (and (symbolp x) (eq (char (symbol-name x) 0) #\?)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 24.2: Toplevel macro.


Figures 24.2--24.4 contain the code for a simple Prolog interpreter. It
accepts the same queries as the query interpreter of Section 19.3, but
uses rules instead of the database to generate bindings. The query
interpreter was invoked through a macro called with-answer. The
interface to the Prolog interpreter will be through a similar macro,
called with-inference. Like with-answer, with-inference is given a query
and a series of Lisp expressions. Variables in the query are symbols
beginning with a question mark:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (with-inference (painter ?x)
            (print ?x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

A call to with-inference expands into code that will evaluate the Lisp
expressions for each set of bindings generated by the query. The call
above, for example, will print each x for which it is possible to infer
(painter x). #

Figure 24.2 shows the definition of with-inference, together with the
function it calls to retrieve bindings. One notable difference between
with-answer and with-inference is that the former simply collected all
the valid bindings. The new program searches nondeterministically. We
see this in the definition of with-inference: instead of expanding into
a loop, it expands into code which will return one set of bindings,
followed by a fail to restart the search. This gives us iteration
implicitly, as in:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (choose-bind x '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
    (princ x)
    (if (= x 6) x (fail)))
    0123456
    6
#+END_EXAMPLE

The function fullbind points to another difference between with-answer
and with-inference. Tracing back through a series of rules can build up
binding lists in which the binding of a variable is a list of other
variables. To make use of the results of a query we now need a recursive
function for retrieving bindings. This is the purpose of fullbind:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq b '((?x . (?y . ?z)) (?y . foo) (?z . nil)))
    ((?X ?Y . ?Z) (?Y . FOO) (?Z))
    > (values (binding '?x b))
    (?Y . ?Z)
    > (fullbind '?x b)
    (FOO)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Bindings for the query are generated by a call to prove-query in the
expansion of with-inference. Figure 24.3 shows the definition of this
function and the functions it calls. This code is structurally
isomorphic to the query interpreter described in Section 19.3. Both
programs use the same functions for matching, but where the query
interpreter used mapping or iteration, the Prolog interpreter uses
equivalent chooses.

Using nondeterministic search instead of iteration does make the
interpretation of negated queries a bit more complex. Given a query like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (not (painter ?x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

the query interpreter could just try to establish bindings for (painter
?x), returning nil if any were found. With nondeterministic search we
have to be more careful: we don't want the interpretation of (painter
?x) to fail back outside the scope of the not, nor do we want it to
leave saved paths that might be restarted later. So now the test for
(painter ?x) is done with a temporarily empty list of saved states, and
the old list is restored on the way out.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (=defun prove-query (expr binds)
        (case (car expr)
          (and (prove-and (cdr expr) binds))
          (or (prove-or (cdr expr) binds))
          (not (prove-not (cadr expr) binds))
          (t (prove-simple expr binds))))

    (=defun prove-and (clauses binds)
        (if (null clauses)
            (=values binds)
          (=bind (binds) (prove-query (car clauses) binds)
             (prove-and (cdr clauses) binds))))

    (=defun prove-or (clauses binds)
        (choose-bind c clauses
                 (prove-query c binds)))

    (=defun prove-not (expr binds)
        (let ((save-paths *paths*))
          (setq *paths* nil)
          (choose (=bind (b) (prove-query expr binds)
                 (setq *paths* save-paths)
                 (fail))
              (progn
                (setq *paths* save-paths)
                (=values binds)))))

    (=defun prove-simple (query binds)
        (choose-bind r *rlist*
                 (implies r query binds)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 24.3: Interpretation of queries.


Another difference between this program and the query interpreter is in
the interpretation of simple patterns--expressions such as (painter ?x)
which consist just of a predicate and some arguments. When the query
interpreter generated bindings for a simple pattern, it called lookup
(page 251). Now, instead of calling lookup, we have to get any bindings
implied by the rules.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defvar *rlist* nil)

    (defmacro <- (con &rest ant)
      (let ((ant (if (= (length ant) 1)
             (car ant)
               `(and ,@ant))))
        `(length (conc1f *rlist* (rep_ (cons ',ant ',con))))))

    (=defun implies (r query binds)
        (let ((r2 (change-vars r)))
          (aif2 (match query (cdr r2) binds)
            (prove-query (car r2) it)
            (fail))))

    (defun change-vars (r)
      (sublis (mapcar #'(lambda (v)
                  (cons v (symb '? (gensym))))
              (vars-in r #'atom))
          r))

Figure 24.5: Syntax of rules.


Code for defining and using rules is shown in Figure 24.4. The rules are
kept in a global list, *rlist*. Each rule is represented as a dotted
pair of body and head. At the time a rule is defined, all the
underscores are replaced with unique variables.

The definition of <- follows three conventions often used in programs of
this type:

1. New rules are added to the end rather than the front of the list, so
   that they will be applied in the order that they were defined.
2. Rules are expressed head first, since that's the order in which the
   program examines them.
3. Multiple expressions in the body are within an implicit and. The
   outermost call to length in the expansion of <- is simply to avoid
   printing a huge list when <- is called from the toplevel.

The syntax of rules is given in Figure 24.5. The head of a rule must be
a pattern for a fact: a list of a predicate followed by zero or more
arguments. The body may be any query that could be handled by the query
interpreter of Chapter 19. Here is the rule from earlier in this
chapter:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (painter ?x) (and (hungry ?x)
                  (smells-of ?x turpentine)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

or just

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (painter ?x) (hungry ?x)
        (smells-of ?x turpentine))
#+END_EXAMPLE

As in the query interpreter, arguments like turpentine do not get
evaluated, so they don't have to be quoted.

When prove-simple is asked to generate bindings for a query, it
nondeterministically chooses a rule and sends both rule and query to
implies. The latter function then tries to match the query with the head
of the rule. If the match succeeds, implies will call prove-query to
establish bindings for the body. Thus we recursively search the tree of
implications.

The function change-vars replaces all the variables in a rule with fresh
ones. An ?x used in one rule is meant to be independent of one used in
another. In order to avoid conflicts with existing bindings, change-vars
is called each time a rule is used.

For the convenience of the user, it is possible to use (underscore)as a
wildcard variable in rules. When a rule is defined, the function rep is
called to change each underscore into a real variable. Underscores can
also be used in the queries given to with-inference.

<<Rules>><<SEC150>>

** 24.3 Rules
This section shows how to write rules for our Prolog. To start with,
here are the two rules from Section 24.1:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (painter ?x) (hungry ?x)
        (smells-of ?x turpentine))

    (<- (hungry ?x) (or (gaunt ?x) (eats-ravenously ?x)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we also assert the following facts:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (gaunt raoul))

    (<- (smells-of raoul turpentine))

    (<- (painter rubens))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then we will get the bindings they generate according to the order in
which they were defined:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-inference (painter ?x)
    (print ?x))
    RAOUL
    RUBENS
#+END_EXAMPLE

The with-inferencemacro has exactly the same restrictions on variable
binding as with-answer. (See Section 19.4.)

We can write rules which imply that facts of a given form are true for
all possible bindings. This happens, for example, when some variable
occurs in the head of a rule but not in the body. The rule

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (eats ?x ?f) (glutton ?x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Says that if ?x is a glutton, then ?x eats everything. Because ?f
doesn't occur in the body, we can prove any fact of the form (eats ?x y)
simply by establishing a binding for ?x. If we make a query with a
literal value as the second argument to eats,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (<- (glutton hubert))
    7
    > (with-inference (eats ?x spinach)
    (print ?x))
    HUBERT
#+END_EXAMPLE

then any literal value will work. When we give a variable as the second
argument:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-inference (eats ?x ?y)
    (print (list ?x ?y)))
    (HUBERT #:G229)
#+END_EXAMPLE

we get a gensym back. Returning a gensym as the binding of a variable in
the query is a way of signifying that any value would be true there.
Programs can be written explicitly to take advantage of this convention:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (progn
    (<- (eats monster bad-children))
    (<- (eats warhol candy)))
    9
    > (with-inference (eats ?x ?y)
    (format t "~A eats ~A.~%"
    ?x
    (if (gensym? ?y) 'everything ?y)))
    HUBERT eats EVERYTHING.
    MONSTER eats BAD-CHILDREN.
    WARHOL eats CANDY.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, if we want to specify that facts of a certain form will be true
for any arguments, we make the body a conjunction with no arguments. The
expression (and) will always behave as a true fact. In the macro <-
(Figure 24.4), the body defaults to (and), so for such rules we can
simply omit the body:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (<- (identical ?x ?x))
    10
    > (with-inference (identical a ?x)
    (print ?x))
    A
#+END_EXAMPLE

For readers with some knowledge of Prolog, Figure 24.6 shows the
translation from Prolog syntax into that of our program. The traditional
first Prolog program is append, which would be written as at the end of
Figure 24.6. In an instance of appending, two shorter lists are joined
together to form a single larger one. Any two of these lists define what
the third should be. The Lisp function append takes the two shorter
lists as arguments and returns the longer one. Prolog append is more
general; the two rules in Figure 24.6 define a program which, given any
two of the lists involved, can find the third.

Our syntax differs from traditional Prolog syntax as follows:

1. Variables are represented by symbols beginning with question marks
   instead of capital letters. Common Lisp is not case-sensitive by
   default, so it would be more trouble than it's worth to use capitals.
2. [ ] becomes nil.
3. Expressions of the form [x | y] become (x . y).
4. Expressions of the form [x, y, ...] become (x y ...).
5. Predicates are moved inside parentheses, and no commas separate
   arguments: pred(x, y, ...) becomes (pred x y ...).

Thus the Prolog definition of append:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    append([ ], Xs, Xs).
    append([X | Xs], Ys, [X | Zs]) <- append(Xs, Ys, Zs).
#+END_EXAMPLE

becomes:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (append nil ?xs ?xs))

    (<- (append (?x . ?xs) ?ys (?x . ?zs))
        (append ?xs ?ys ?zs))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 24.6: Prolog syntax equivalence.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-inference (append ?x (c d) (a b c d))
    (format t "Left: ~A~%" ?x))
    Left: (A B)

    > (with-inference (append (a b) ?x (a b c d))
    (format t "Right: ~A~%" ?x))
    Right: (C D)

    > (with-inference (append (a b) (c d) ?x)
    (format t "Whole: ~A~%" ?x))
    Whole: (A B C D)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Not only that, but given only the last list, it can find all the
possibilities for the first two:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-inference (append ?x ?y (a b c))
    (format t "Left: ~A Right: ~A~%" ?x ?y))
    Left: NIL Right: (A B C)
    Left: (A) Right: (B C)
    Left: (A B) Right: (C)
    Left: (A B C) Right: NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

The case of append points to a great difference between Prolog and other
languages. A collection of Prolog rules does not have to yield a
specific value. It can instead yield constraints, which, when combined
with constraints generated by other parts of the program, yield a
specific value. For example, if we define member thus:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (member ?x (?x . ?rest)))

    (<- (member ?x (_ . ?rest)) (member ?x ?rest))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then we can use it to test for list membership, as we would use the Lisp
function member:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-inference (member a (a b)) (print t))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

but we can also use it to establish a constraint of membership, which,
combined with other constraints, yields a specific list. If we also have
a predicate cara

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (cara (a _)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which is true of any two-element list whose car is a, then between that
and member we have enough constraint for Prolog to construct a definite
answer:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-inference (and (cara ?lst) (member b ?lst))
    (print ?lst))
    (A B)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is a rather trivial example, but bigger programs can be constructed
on the same principle. Whenever we want to program by combining partial
solutions,

Prolog may be useful. Indeed, a surprising variety of problems can be
expressed in such terms: Figure 24.14, for example, shows a sorting
algorithm expressed as a collection of constraints on the solution.

<<The Need for Nondeterminism>><<SEC151>>

** 24.4 The Need for Nondeterminism
Chapter 22 explained the relation between deterministic and
nondeterministic search. A deterministic search program could take a
query and generate all the solutions which satisfied it. A
nondeterministic search program will use choose to generate solutions
one at a time, and if more are needed, will call fail to restart the
search.

When we have rules which all yield finite sets of bindings, and we want
all of them at once, there is no reason to prefer nondeterministic
search. The difference between the two strategies becomes apparent when
we have queries which would generate an infinite number of bindings, of
which we want a finite subset. For example, the rules

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (all-elements ?x nil))

    (<- (all-elements ?x (?x . ?rest))
        (all-elements ?x ?rest))
#+END_EXAMPLE

imply all the facts of the form (all-elements x y), where every member
of y is equal to x. Without backtracking we could handle queries like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (all-elements a (a a a))

    (all-elements a (a a b))

    (all-elements ?x (a a a))
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, the query (all-elements a ?x) is satisfied for an infinite
number of possible ?x: nil, (a), (a a), and so on. If we try to generate
answers for this query by iteration, the iteration will never terminate.
Even if we only wanted one of the answers, we would never get a result
from an implementation which had to generate all the bindings for the
query before it could begin to iterate through the Lisp expressions
following it.

This is why with-inference interleaves the generation of bindings with
the evaluation of its body. Where queries could lead to an infinite
number of answers, the only successful approach will be to generate
answers one at a time, and return to pick up new ones by restarting the
suspended search. Because it uses choose and fail, our program can
handle this case:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (block nil
    (with-inference (all-elements a ?x)
    (if (= (length ?x) 3)
    (return ?x)
    (princ ?x))))
    NIL(A)(A A)
    (A A A)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Like any other Prolog implementation, ours simulates nondeterminism by
doing depth-first search with backtracking. In theory, "logic programs"
run under true nondeterminism. In fact, Prolog implementations always
use depth-first search. Far from being inconvenienced by this choice,
typical Prolog programs depend on it. In a truly nondeterministic world,
the query

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (and (all-elements a ?x) (length ?x 3))
#+END_EXAMPLE

has an answer, but it takes you arbitrarily long to find out what it is.

Not only does Prolog use the depth-first implementation of
nondeterminism, it uses a version equivalent to that defined on page
293. As explained there, this implementation is not always guaranteed to
terminate. So Prolog programmers must take deliberate steps to avoid
loops in the search space. For example, if we had defined member in the
reverse order

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (member ?x (_ . ?rest)) (member ?x ?rest))

    (<- (member ?x (?x . ?rest)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then logically it would have the same meaning, but as a Prolog program
it would have a different effect. The original definition of member
would yield an infinite stream of answers in response to the query
(member 'a ?x), but the reversed definition will yield an infinite
recursion, and no answers.

<<New Implementation>><<SEC152>>

** 24.5 New Implementation
In this section we will see another instance of a familiar pattern. In
Section 18.4, we found after writing the initial version that if-match
could be made much faster. By taking advantage of information known at
compile-time, we were able to write a new version which did less work at
runtime. We saw the same phenomenon on a larger scale in Chapter 19. Our
query interpreter was replaced by an equivalent but faster version. The
same thing is about to happen to our Prolog interpreter.

Figures 24.7, 24.8, and 24.10 define Prolog in a different way. The
macro with-inference used to be just the interface to a Prolog
interpreter. Now it is most of the program. The new program has the same
general shape as the old one, but of the functions defined in Figure
24.8, only prove is called at runtime. The others are called by
with-inference in order to generate its expansion.

Figure 24.7 shows the new definition of with-inference. As in if-match
or with-answer, pattern variables are initially bound to gensyms to
indicate that they haven't yet been assigned real values by matching.
Thus the function varsym?, which match and fullbind use to detect
variables, has to be changed to look for gensyms.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro with-inference (query &rest body)
      (let ((vars (vars-in query #'simple?)) (gb (gensym)))
        `(with-gensyms ,vars
               (setq *paths* nil)
               (=bind (,gb) ,(gen-query (rep_ query))
                  (let ,(mapcar #'(lambda (v)
                            `(,v (fullbind ,v ,gb)))
                        vars)
                    ,@body)
                  (fail)))))

    (defun varsym? (x)
      (and (symbolp x) (not (symbol-package x))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 24.7: New toplevel macro.


To generate the code to establish bindings for the query, with-inference
calls gen-query (Figure 24.8). The first thing gen-query does is look to
see whether its first argument is a complex query beginning with an
operator like and or or. This process continues recursively until it
reaches simple queries, which are expanded into calls to prove. In the
original implementation, such logical structure was analyzed at runtime.
A complex expression occurring in the body of a rule had to be analyzed
anew each time the rule was used. This is wasteful because the logical
structure of rules and queries is known beforehand. The new
implementation decomposes complex expressions at compile-time.

As in the previous implementation, a with-inference expression expands
into code which iterates through the Lisp code following the query with
the pattern variables bound to successive values established by the
rules. The expansion of with-inference concludes with a fail, which will
restart any saved states.

The remaining functions in Figure 24.8 generate expansions for complex
queries--queries joined together by operators like and, or, and not. If
we have a query like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (and (big ?x) (red ?x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then we want the Lisp code to be evaluated only with those ?x for which
both conjuncts can be proved. So to generate the expansion of an and, we
nest the expansion of the second conjunct within that of the first. When
(big ?x) succeeds we try (red ?x), and if that succeeds, we evaluate the
Lisp expressions. So the whole expression expands as in Figure 24.9.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun gen-query (expr &optional binds)
      (case (car expr)
        (and (gen-and (cdr expr) binds))
        (or (gen-or (cdr expr) binds))
        (not (gen-not (cadr expr) binds))
        (t `(prove (list ',(car expr)
                 ,@(mapcar #'form (cdr expr)))
               ,binds))))

    (defun gen-and (clauses binds)
      (if (null clauses)
          `(=values ,binds)
        (let ((gb (gensym)))
          `(=bind (,gb) ,(gen-query (car clauses) binds)
              ,(gen-and (cdr clauses) gb)))))

    (defun gen-or (clauses binds)

              (=bind (#:g1) (=bind (#:g2) (prove (list 'big ?x) nil)

                          (=values #:g3)))
                 (let ((?x (fullbind ?x #:g1)))

                 (fail)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

An and means nesting; an or means a choose. Given a query like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (or (big ?x) (red ?x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

we want the Lisp expressions to be evaluated for values of ?x
established by either subquery. The function gen-or expands into a
choose over the gen-query of each of the arguments. As for not, gen-not
is almost identical to prove-not (Figure 24.3).

Figure 24.10 shows the code for defining rules. Rules are translated
directly into Lisp code generated by rule-fn. Since <- now expands rules
into Lisp code, compiling a file full of rule definitions will cause
rules to be compiled functions.

When a rule-function is sent a pattern, it tries to match it with the
head of the rule it represents. If the match succeeds, the rule-function
will then try to establish bindings for the body. This task is
essentially the same as that done by with-inference, and in fact rule-fn
ends by calling gen-query. The rule-function eventually returns the
bindings established for the variables occurring in the head of the
rule.

<<Adding Prolog Features>><<SEC153>>

** 24.6 Adding Prolog Features
The code already presented can run most "pure" Prolog programs. The
final step is to add extras like cuts, arithmetic, and I/O.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defvar *rules* nil)

    (defmacro <- (con &rest ant)
      (let ((ant (if (= (length ant) 1)
             (car ant)
               `(and ,@ant))))
        `(length (conc1f *rules*
                 ,(rule-fn (rep_ ant) (rep_ con))))))

    (defun rule-fn (ant con)
      (with-gensyms (val win fact binds)
            `(=lambda (,fact ,binds)
                  (with-gensyms ,(vars-in (list ant con) #'simple?)
                        (multiple-value-bind
                            (,val ,win)
                            (match ,fact
                               (list ',(car con)
                                 ,@(mapcar #'form (cdr con)))
                               ,binds)
                          (if ,win
                              ,(gen-query ant val)
                            (fail)))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 24.10: Code for defining rules.


Putting a cut in a Prolog rule causes the search tree to be pruned.
Ordinarily, when our program encounters a fail, it backtracks to the
last choice point. The implementation of choose in Section 22.4 stores
choice points in the global variable *paths*. Calling fail restarts the
search at the most recent choice point, which is the car of *paths*.
Cuts introduce a new complication. When the program encounters a cut, it
will throw away some of the most recent choice points stored on
*paths*---specifically, all those stored since the last call to prove.

The effect is to make rules mutually exclusive. We can use cuts to get
the effect of a case statement in Prolog programs. For example, if we
define minimum this way:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (minimum ?x ?y ?x) (lisp (<= ?x ?y)))

    (<- (minimum ?x ?y ?y) (lisp (> ?x ?y)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

it will work correctly, but inefficiently. Given the query

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (minimum 1 2 ?x)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Prolog will immediately establish that ?x = 1 from the first rule. A
human would stop here, but the program will waste time looking for more
answers from the second rule, because it has been given no indication
that the two rules are mutually exclusive. On the average, this version
of minimum will do 50% more work than it needs to. We can fix the
problem by adding a cut after the first test:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (minimum ?x ?y ?x) (lisp (<= ?x ?y)) (cut))

    (<- (minimum ?x ?y ?y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now when Prolog has finished with the first rule, it will fail all the
way out of the query instead of moving on to the next rule.

It is trivially easy to modify our program to handle cuts. On each call
to prove, the current state of *paths* is passed as a parameter. If the
program encounters a cut, it just sets *paths* back to the old value
passed in the parameter. Figures 24.11 and 24.12 show the code which has
to be modified to handle cuts. (Changed lines are marked with
semicolons. Not all the changes are due to cuts.)

Cuts which merely make a program more efficient are called green cuts.
The cut in minimum was a green cut. Cuts which make a program behave
differently are called red cuts. For example, if we define the predicate
artist as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (artist ?x) (sculptor ?x) (cut))

    (<- (artist ?x) (painter ?x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

the result is that, if there are any sculptors, then the query can end
there. If there are no sculptors then painters get to be considered as
artists:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (progn (<- (painter 'klee))
    (<- (painter 'soutine)))
    4
    > (with-inference (artist ?x)
    (print ?x))
    KLEE
    SOUTINE
#+END_EXAMPLE

But if there are sculptors, the cut stops inference with the first rule:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (<- (sculptor 'hepworth))
    5
    > (with-inference (artist ?x)
    (print ?x))
    HEPWORTH
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 24.13: New syntax of rules.


The cut is sometimes used in conjunction with the Prolog fail operator.
Our function fail does exactly the same thing. Putting a cut in a rule
makes it like a one-way street: once you enter, you're committed to
using only that rule. Putting a cut-fail combination in a rule makes it
like a one-way street in a dangerous neighborhood: once you enter,
you're committed to leaving with nothing. A typical example is in the
implementation of not-equal:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (not-equal ?x ?x) (cut) (fail))

    (<- (not-equal ?x ?y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The first rule here is a trap for impostors. If we're trying to prove a
fact of the form (not-equal 1 1), it will match with the head of the
first rule and thus be doomed. The query (not-equal 1 2), on the other
hand, will not match the head of the first rule, and will go on to the
second, where it succeeds:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-inference (not-equal 'a 'a)
    (print t))

    > (with-inference (not-equal '(a a) '(a b))
    (print t))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

The code shown in Figures 24.11 and 24.12 also gives our program
arithmetic, I/O, and the Prolog is operator. Figure 24.13 shows the
complete syntax of rules and queries.

We add arithmetic (and more) by including a trapdoor to Lisp. Now in
addition to operators like and and or, we have the lisp operator. This
may be followed by any Lisp expression, which will be evaluated with the
variables within it bound to the bindings established for them by the
query. If the expression evaluates to nil, then the lisp expression as a
whole is equivalent to a (fail); otherwise it is equivalent to (and).

As an example of the use of the lisp operator, consider the Prolog
definition of ordered, which is true of lists whose elements are
arranged in ascending order:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (ordered (?x)))

    (<- (ordered (?x ?y . ?ys))
        (lisp (<= ?x ?y))
        (ordered (?y . ?ys)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

In English, a list of one element is ordered, and a list of two or more
elements is ordered if the first element of the list is less than or
equal to the second, and the list from the second element on is ordered.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-inference (ordered '(1 2 3))
    (print t))
    T

    > (with-inference (ordered '(1 3 2))
    (print t))
#+END_EXAMPLE

By means of the lisp operator we can provide other features offered by
typical Prolog implementations. Prolog I/O predicates can be duplicated
by putting Lisp I/O calls within lisp expressions. The Prolog assert,
which as a side-effect defines new rules, can be duplicated by calling
the <- macro within lisp expressions.

The is operator offers a form of assignment. It takes two arguments, a
pattern and a Lisp expression, and tries to match the pattern with the
result returned by the expression. If the match fails, then the program
calls fail; otherwise it proceeds with the new bindings. Thus, the
expression (is ?x 1) has the effect of setting ?x to 1, or more
precisely, insisting that ?x be 1. We need is to calculate--for example,
to calculate factorials:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (factorial 0 1))

    (<- (factorial ?n ?f)
        (lisp (> ?n 0))
        (is ?n1 (- ?n 1))
        (factorial ?n1 ?f1)
        (is ?f (* ?n ?f1)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

We use this definition by making a query with a number n as the first
argument and a variable as the second:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-inference (factorial 8 ?x)
    (print ?x))
    40320
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that the variables used in a lisp expression, or in the second
argument to is, must have established bindings for the expression to
return a value. This restriction holds in any Prolog. For example, the
query:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (with-inference (factorial ?x 120)                 ; wrong
            (print ?x))
#+END_EXAMPLE

won't work with this definition of factorial, because ?n will be unknown
when the lisp expression is evaluated. So not all Prolog programs are
like append: many insist, like factorial, that certain of their
arguments be real values.

<<Examples>><<SEC154>>

** 24.7 Examples
This final section shows how to write some example Prolog programs in
our # implementation. The rules in Figure 24.14 define quicksort. These
rules imply facts of the form (quicksort x y), where x is a list and y
is a list of the same elements sorted in ascending order. Variables may
appear in the second argument position:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-inference (quicksort '(3 2 1) ?x)
    (print ?x))
    (1 2 3)
#+END_EXAMPLE

An I/O loop is a test for our Prolog, because it makes use of the cut,
lisp, and is operators. The code is shown in Figure 24.15. These rules
should be invoked by trying to prove (echo), with no arguments. That
query will match the first rule, which will bind ?x to the result
returned by read, and then try to establish (echo ?x). The new query can
match either of the second two rules. If ?x = done, then the query will
terminate in the second rule. Otherwise the query will only match the
third rule, which prints the value read, and starts the process over
again.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq *rules* nil)

    (<- (append nil ?ys ?ys))

    (<- (append (?x . ?xs) ?ys (?x . ?zs))
        (append ?xs ?ys ?zs))

    (<- (quicksort (?x . ?xs) ?ys)
        (partition ?xs ?x ?littles ?bigs)
        (quicksort ?littles ?ls)
        (quicksort ?bigs ?bs)
        (append ?ls (?x . ?bs) ?ys))

    (<- (quicksort nil nil))

    (<- (partition (?x . ?xs) ?y (?x . ?ls) ?bs)
        (lisp (<= ?x ?y))
        (partition ?xs ?y ?ls ?bs))

    (<- (partition (?x . ?xs) ?y ?ls (?x . ?bs))
        (lisp (> ?x ?y))
        (partition ?xs ?y ?ls ?bs))

    (<- (partition nil ?y nil nil))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 24.14: Quicksort.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (<- (echo)
        (is ?x (read))
        (echo ?x))

    (<- (echo 'done)
        (cut))

    (<- (echo ?x)
        (lisp (prog1 t (format t "~A~%" ?x)))
        (is ?y (read))
        (cut)
        (echo ?y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 24.15: An I/O loop in Prolog.


Collectively, the rules define a program that will continue to echo what
you type, until you type done:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (with-inference (echo))
    hi
    HI
    ho
    HO
    done
#+END_EXAMPLE

Programs like this are difficult to read because they subvert the
abstract model of Prolog. It might be easier to understand echo if we
look at a literal Lisp translation

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun echo (&rest args)
      (cond ((null args) (echo (read)))
        ((eq (car args) 'done) nil)
        (t (format t "~A~%" (car args))
           (echo (read)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

which in idiomatic Common Lisp would be:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun echo (&optional (arg (read)))
      (unless (eq arg 'done)
        (format t "~A~%" arg)
        (echo)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<The Senses of Compile>><<SEC155>>

** 24.8 The Senses of Compile
The word "compile" has several senses. In the most general sense, to
compile is to transform some abstract description of a program into
lower-level code. The program described in this chapter is certainly a
compiler in this sense, because it translates rules into Lisp functions.

In a more specific sense, to compile is to transform a program into
machine language. Good Common Lisps compile functions into native
machine code. As mentioned on page 25, if code which generates closures
is compiled, it will yield compiled closures. Thus the program described
here is a compiler in the stricter sense as well. In a good Lisp, our
Prolog programs will get translated into machine language.

However, the program described here is still not a Prolog compiler. For
programming languages there is a still more specific sense of "compile,"
and merely generating machine code is not enough to satisfy this
definition. A compiler for a programming language must optimize as well
as translate. For example, if a Lisp compiler is asked to compile an
expression like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (+ x (+ 2 5))
#+END_EXAMPLE

it should be smart enough to realize that there is no reason to wait
until runtime to evaluate (+ 2 5). The program can be optimized by
replacing it with 7, and instead compiling

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (+ x 7)
#+END_EXAMPLE

In our program, all the compiling is done by the Lisp compiler, and it
is looking for Lisp optimizations, not Prolog optimizations. Its
optimizations will be valid ones, but too low-level. The Lisp compiler
doesn't know that the code it's compiling is meant to represent rules.
While a real Prolog compiler would be looking for rules that could be
transformed into loops, our program is looking for expressions that
yield constants, or closures that could be allocated on the stack.

Embedded languages allow you to make the most of available abstractions,
but they are not magic. If you want to travel all the way from a very
abstract representation to fast machine code, someone still has to tell
the computer how to do it. In this chapter we travelled a good part of
that distance with surprisingly little code, but that is not the same as
writing a true Prolog compiler.

* 25. Object-Oriented Lisp
This chapter discusses object-oriented programming in Lisp. Common Lisp
includes a set of operators for writing object-oriented programs.
Collectively they are called the Common Lisp Object System, or CLOS.
Here we consider CLOS not just as a way of writing object-oriented
programs, but as a Lisp program itself. Seeing CLOS in this light is the
key to understanding the relation between Lisp and object-oriented
programming.

** 25.1 Plus ca Change
Object-oriented programming means a change in the way programs are
organized. This change is analogous to the one that has taken place in
the distribution of processor power. In 1970, a multi-user computer
system meant one or two big mainframes connected to a large number of
dumb terminals. Now it is more likely to mean a large number of
workstations connected to one another by a network. The processing power
of the system is now distributed among individual users instead of
centralized in one big computer.

Object-oriented programming breaks up traditional programs in much the
same way: instead of having a single program which operates on an inert
mass of data, the data itself is told how to behave, and the program is
implicit in the interactions of these new data "objects."

For example, suppose we want to write a program to find the areas of
two-dimensional shapes. One way to do this would be to write a single
function which looked at the type of its argument and behaved
accordingly:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun area (x)
      (cond ((rectangle-p x) (* (height x) (width x)))
        ((circle-p x) (* pi (expt (radius x) 2)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The object-oriented approach is to make each object able to calculate
its own area. The area function is broken apart and each clause
distributed to the appropriate class of object; the area method of the
rectangle class might be

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #'
    (lambda (x) (* (height x) (width x)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

and for the circle class,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #'
    (lambda (x) (* pi (expt (radius x) 2)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

In this model, we ask an object what its area is, and it responds
according to the method provided for its class.

The arrival of CLOS might seem a sign that Lisp is changing to embrace
the object-oriented paradigm. Actually, it would be more accurate to say
that Lisp is staying the same to embrace the object-oriented paradigm.
But the principles underlying Lisp don't have a name, and
object-oriented programming does, so # there is a tendency now to
describe Lisp as an object-oriented language. It would be closer to the
truth to say that Lisp is an extensible language in which constructs for
object-oriented programming can easily be written.

Since CLOS comes pre-written, it is not false advertising to describe
Lisp as an object-oriented language. However, it would be limiting to
see Lisp as merely that. Lisp is an object-oriented language, yes, but
not because it has adopted the object-oriented model. Rather, that model
turns out to be just one more permutation of the abstractions underlying
Lisp. And to prove it we have CLOS, a program written in Lisp, which
makes Lisp an object-oriented language.

The aim of this chapter is to bring out the connection between Lisp and
object-oriented programming by studying CLOS as an example of an
embedded language. This is also a good way to understand CLOS itself: in
the end, nothing explains a language feature more effectively than a
sketch of its implementation. In Section 7.6, macros were explained this
way. The next section gives a similar sketch of how to build
object-oriented abstractions on top of Lisp. This program provides a
reference point from which to describe CLOS in Sections 25.3--25.6.

<<Objects in Plain Lisp>><<SEC158>>

** 25.2 Objects in Plain Lisp
We can mold Lisp into many different kinds of languages. There is a
particularly direct mapping between the concepts of object-oriented
programming and the fundamental abstractions of Lisp. The size of CLOS
tends to obscure this fact. So before looking at what we can do with
CLOS, let's see what we can do with plain Lisp.

Much of what we want from object-oriented programming, we have already
in Lisp. We can get the rest with surprisingly little code. In this
section, we will define an object system sufficient for many real
applications in two pages of code. Object-oriented programming, at a
minimum, implies

1. objects which have properties
2. and respond to messages,
3. and which inherit properties and methods from their parents.

In Lisp, there are already several ways to store collections of
properties. One way would be to represent objects as hash-tables, and
store their properties as entries within them. We then have access to
individual properties through gethash:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (gethash 'color obj)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Since functions are data objects, we can store them as properties too.
This means that we can also have methods; to invoke a given method of an
object is to funcall the property of that name:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (funcall (gethash 'move obj) obj 10)
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can define a Smalltalk style message-passing syntax upon this idea:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun tell (obj message &rest args)
      (apply (gethash message obj) obj args))
#+END_EXAMPLE

so that to tell obj to move 10 we can say

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (tell obj 'move 10)
#+END_EXAMPLE

In fact, the only ingredient plain Lisp lacks is inheritance, and we can
provide a rudimentary version of that in six lines of code, by defining
a recursive version of gethash:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun rget (obj prop)
      (multiple-value-bind (val win) (gethash prop obj)
        (if win
        (values val win)
          (let ((par (gethash 'parent obj)))
        (and par (rget par prop))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun rget (obj prop)
      (some2 #'(lambda (a) (gethash prop a))
         (get-ancestors obj)))

    (defun get-ancestors (obj)
      (labels ((getall (x)
               (append (list x)
                   (mapcan #'getall
                       (gethash 'parents x)))))
        (stable-sort (delete-duplicates (getall obj))
             #'(lambda (x y)
                 (member y (gethash 'parents x))))))

    (defun some2 (fn lst)
      (if (atom lst)
          nil
        (multiple-value-bind (val win) (funcall fn (car lst))
          (if (or val win)
          (values val win)
        (some2 fn (cdr lst))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 25.1: Multiple inheritance.


If we just use rget in place of gethash, we will get inherited
properties and methods. We specify an object's parent thus:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (gethash 'parent obj) obj2)
#+END_EXAMPLE

So far we have only single inheritance--an object can only have one
parent. But we can have multiple inheritance by making the parent
property a list, and defining rget as in Figure 25.1.

With single inheritance, when we wanted to retrieve some property of an
object, we just searched recursively up its ancestors. If the object
itself had no information about the property we wanted, we looked at its
parent, and so on. With multiple inheritance we want to perform the same
kind of search, but our job is complicated by the fact that an object's
ancestors can form a graph instead of a simple list. We can't just
search this graph depth-first. With multiple parents we can have the
hierarchy shown in Figure 25.2: a is descended from b and c, which are
both descended from d. A depth-first (or rather, height-first) traversal
would go a, b, d, c, d. If the desired property were present in both d
and c, we would get the value stored in d, not the one stored in c. This
would violate the principle that subclasses override the default values
provided by their parents.

Figure 25.2: Multiple paths to a superclass.


If wewant to implement the usual idea of inheritance,we should never
examine an object before one of its descendants. In this case, the
proper search order would be a, b, c, d. How can we ensure that the
search always tries descendants first?

The simplest way is to assemble a list of all the ancestors of the
original object, sort the list so that no object appears before one of
its descendants, and then look at each element in turn.

This strategy is used by get-ancestors,which returns a properly ordered
list of an object and its ancestors. To sort the list, get-ancestors
calls stable-sort # instead of sort, to avoid the possibility of
reordering parallel ancestors. Once the list is sorted, rget merely
searches for the first object with the desired property. (The utility
some2 is a version of some for use with functions like gethash that
indicate success or failure in the second return value.)

The list of an object's ancestors goes from most specific to least
specific: if orange is a child of citrus, which is a child of fruit,
then the list will go

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (orange citrus fruit).
#+END_EXAMPLE

When an object has multiple parents, their precedence goes
left-to-right. That is, if we say

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (gethash 'parents x) (list y z))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then y will be considered before z when we look for an inherited
property. For example, we can say that a patriotic scoundrel is a
scoundrel first and a patriot second:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq scoundrel (make-hash-table)
    patriot (make-hash-table)
    patriotic-scoundrel (make-hash-table))
    #<Hash-Table C4219E>
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setf (gethash 'serves scoundrel) 'self
    (gethash 'serves patriot) 'country
    (gethash 'parents patriotic-scoundrel)
    (list scoundrel patriot))
    (#<Hash-Table C41C7E> #<Hash-Table C41F0E>)
    > (rget patriotic-scoundrel 'serves)
    SELF
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun obj (&rest parents)
      (let ((obj (make-hash-table)))
        (setf (gethash 'parents obj) parents)
        (ancestors obj)
        obj))

    (defun ancestors (obj)
      (or (gethash 'ancestors obj)
          (setf (gethash 'ancestors obj) (get-ancestors obj))))

    (defun rget (obj prop)
      (some2 #'(lambda (a) (gethash prop a))
         (ancestors obj)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 25.3: A function to create objects.


Let's make some improvements to this skeletal system. We could begin
with a function to create objects. This function should build a list of
an object's ancestors at the time the object is created. The current
code builds these lists when queries are made, but there is no reason
not to do it earlier. Figure 25.3 defines a function called obj which
creates a new object, storing within it a list of its ancestors. To take
advantage of stored ancestors, we also redefine rget.

Another place for improvement is the syntax of message calls. The tell
itself is unnecessary clutter, and because it makes verbs come second,
it means that our programs can no longer be read like normal Lisp prefix
expressions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (tell (tell obj 'find-owner) 'find-owner)
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can get rid of the tell syntax by defining each property name as a
function, as in Figure 25.4. The optional argument meth?, if true,
signals that this property should be treated as a method. Otherwise it
will be treated as a slot, and the value retrieved by rget will simply
be returned. Once we have defined the name of either kind of property,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro defprop (name &optional meth?)
      `(progn
         (defun ,name (obj &rest args)
           ,(if meth?
            `(run-methods obj ',name args)
          `(rget obj ',name)))
         (defsetf ,name (obj) (val)
           `(setf (gethash ',',name ,obj) ,val))))

    (defun run-methods (obj name args)
      (let ((meth (rget obj name)))
        (if meth
        (apply meth obj args)
          (error "No ~A method for ~A." name obj))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 25.4: Functional syntax.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defprop find-owner t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

we can refer to it with a function call, and our code will read like
Lisp again:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (find-owner (find-owner obj))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Our previous example now becomes somewhat more readable:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (progn
    (setq scoundrel (obj))
    (setq patriot (obj))
    (setq patriotic-scoundrel (obj scoundrel patriot))
    (defprop serves)
    (setf (serves scoundrel) 'self)
    (setf (serves patriot) 'country)
    (serves patriotic-scoundrel))
    SELF
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the current implementation, an object can have at most one method of
a given name. An object either has its own method, or inherits one. It
would be convenient to have more flexibility on this point, so that we
could combine local and inherited methods. For example, we might want
the move method of some object to be the move method of its parent, but
with some extra code run before or afterwards.

To allow for such possibilities, we will modify our program to include
before-, after-, and around-methods. Before-methods allow us to say "But
first, do this." They are called, most specific first, as a prelude to
the rest of the method call. After-methods allow us to say "P.S. Do this
too." They are called, most specific last, as an epilogue to the method
call. Between them, we run what used to be the whole method, and is now
called the primary method. The value of this call is the one returned,
even if after-methods are called later.

Before- and after-methods allow us to wrap new behavior around the call
to the primary method. Around-methods provide a more drastic way of
doing the same thing. If an around-method exists, it will be called
instead of the primary method. Then, at its own discretion, the
around-method may itself invoke the primary method (via call-next, which
will be provided in Figure 25.7).

To allow auxiliary methods, we modify run-methods and rget as in Figures
25.5 and 25.6. In the previous version, when we ran some method of an
object, we ran just one function: the most specific primary method. We
ran the first method we encountered when searching the list of
ancestors. With auxiliary methods, the calling sequence now goes as
follows:

1. The most specific around-method, if there is one.
2. Otherwise, in order:

   1. All before-methods, from most specific to least specific.
   2. The most specific primary method (what we used to call).
   3. All after-methods, from least specific to most specific.

Notice also that instead of being a single function, a method becomes a
four-part structure. To define a (primary) method, instead of saying:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (gethash 'move obj) #'(lambda ...))
#+END_EXAMPLE

we say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setf (meth-primary (gethash 'move obj)) #'(lambda ...))
#+END_EXAMPLE

For this and other reasons, our next step should be to define a macro
for defining methods.

Figure 25.7 shows the definition of such a macro. The bulk of this code
is taken up with implementing two functions that methods can use to
refer to other methods. Around- and primary methods can use call-next to
invoke the next method, which is the code that would have run if the
current method didn't exist.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defstruct meth around before primary after)

    (defmacro meth- (field obj)
      (let ((gobj (gensym)))
        `(let ((,gobj ,obj))
           (and (meth-p ,gobj)
            (,(symb 'meth- field) ,gobj)))))

    (defun run-methods (obj name args)
      (let ((pri (rget obj name :primary)))
        (if pri
        (let ((ar (rget obj name :around)))
          (if ar
              (apply ar obj args)
            (run-core-methods obj name args pri)))
          (error "No primary ~A method for ~A." name obj))))

    (defun run-core-methods (obj name args &optional pri)
      (multiple-value-prog1
       (progn (run-befores obj name args)
          (apply (or pri (rget obj name :primary))
             obj args))
       (run-afters obj name args)))

    (defun rget (obj prop &optional meth (skip 0))
      (some2 #'(lambda (a)
             (multiple-value-bind (val win) (gethash prop a)
               (if win
               (case meth (:around (meth- around val))
                 (:primary (meth- primary val))
                 (t (values val win))))))
         (nthcdr skip (ancestors obj))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 25.5: Auxiliary methods.


For example, if the currently running method is the only around-method,
the next method would be the usual sandwich of before-, most specific
primary, and after-methods. Within the most specific primary method, the
next method would be the second most specific primary method. Since the
behavior of call-next depends on where it is called, it is never defined
globally with a defun, but is defined locally within each method defined
by defmeth.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun run-befores (obj prop args)
      (dolist (a (ancestors obj))
        (let ((bm (meth- before (gethash prop a))))
          (if bm (apply bm obj args)))))

    (defun run-afters (obj prop args)
      (labels ((rec (lst)
            (when lst
              (rec (cdr lst))
              (let ((am (meth- after
                       (gethash prop (car lst)))))
                (if am (apply am (car lst) args))))))
        (rec (ancestors obj))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 25.6: Auxiliary methods (continued).


An around- or primary method can use next-p to check whether there is a
next method. If the current method is the primary method of an object
with no parents, for example, there would be no next method. Since
call-next yields an error when there is no next method, next-p should
usually be called to test the waters first. Like call-next, next-p is
defined locally within individual methods.

The new macro defmeth is used as follows. If we just want to define the
area method of the rectangle object, we say

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq rectangle (obj))

    (defprop height)

    (defprop width)

    (defmeth (area) rectangle (r)
      (* (height r) (width r)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now the area of an instance is calculated according to the method of the
class:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (let ((myrec (obj rectangle)))
    (setf (height myrec) 2
    (width myrec) 3)
    (area myrec))
    6
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro defmeth ((name &optional (type :primary))
               obj parms &body body)
      (let ((gobj (gensym)))
        `(let ((,gobj ,obj))
           (defprop ,name t)
           (unless (meth-p (gethash ',name ,gobj))
         (setf (gethash ',name ,gobj) (make-meth)))
           (setf (,(symb 'meth- type) (gethash ',name ,gobj))
             ,(build-meth name type gobj parms body)))))

    (defun build-meth (name type gobj parms body)
      (let ((gargs (gensym)))
        `#'(lambda (&rest ,gargs)

                    '(error "Illegal call-next.")))
              (next-p ()

                (apply pri obj args)
              (error "No next method."))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 25.7: Defining methods.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro undefmeth ((name &optional (type :primary)) obj)
      `(setf (,(symb 'meth- type) (gethash ',name ,obj))
         nil))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 25.8: Removing methods.


In a more complicated example, suppose we have defined a backup method
for the filesystem object:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq filesystem (obj))

    (defmeth (backup :before) filesystem (fs)
      (format t "Remember to mount the tape.~%"))

    (defmeth (backup) filesystem (fs)
      (format t "Oops, deleted all your files.~%")
      'done)

    (defmeth (backup :after) filesystem (fs)
      (format t "Well, that was easy.~%"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The normal sequence of calls will be as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (backup (obj filesystem))
    Remember to mount the tape.
    Oops, deleted all your files.
    Well, that was easy.
    DONE
#+END_EXAMPLE

Later we want to know how long backups take, so we define the following
around-method:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmeth (backup :around) filesystem (fs)
      (time (call-next)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now whenever backup is called on a child of filesystem (unless more
specific around-methods intervene) our around-method will be called. It
calls the code that would ordinarily run in a call to backup, but within
a call to time. The value returned by time will be returned as the value
of the call to backup:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (backup (obj filesystem))
    Remember to mount the tape.
    Oops, deleted all your files.
    Well, that was easy.
    Elapsed Time = .01 seconds
    DONE
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once we are finished timing the backups, we will want to remove the
around-method. That can be done by calling undefmeth (Figure 25.8),
which takes the same first two arguments as defmeth:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (undefmeth (backup :around) filesystem)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Another thing we might want to alter is an object's list of parents. But
after any such change, we should also update the list of ancestors of
the object and all its children. So far, we have no way of getting from
an object to its children, so we must also add a children property.

Figure 25.9 contains code for operating on objects' parents and
children. Instead of getting at parents and children via gethash, we use
the operators parents and children. The latter is a macro, and therefore
transparent to setf. The former is a function whose inversion is defined
by defsetf to be set-parents, which does everything needed to maintain
consistency in the new doubly-linked world.

To update the ancestors of all the objects in a subtree, set-parents
calls maphier, which is like a mapc for inheritance hierarchies. As mapc
calls a function on every element of a list, maphier calls a function on
an object and all its descendants. Unless they form a proper tree, the
function could get called more than once on some objects. Here this is
harmless, because get-ancestors does the same thing when called multiple
times.

Now we can alter the inheritance hierarchy just by using setf on an
object's parents:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (progn (pop (parents patriotic-scoundrel))
    (serves patriotic-scoundrel))
    COUNTRY
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

When the hierarchy is modified, affected lists of children and ancestors
will be updated automatically. (The children are not meant to be
manipulated directly, but they could be if we defined a set-children
analogous to set-parents.) The last function in Figure 25.9 is obj
redefined to use the new code.

As a final improvement to our system, we will make it possible to
specify new ways of combining methods. Currently, the only primary
method that gets called is the most specific (though it can call others
via call-next). Instead we might like to be able to combine the results
of the primary methods of each of an object's ancestors. For example,
suppose that my-orange is a child of orange, which is a child of citrus.
If the props method returns (round acidic) for citrus, (orange sweet)
for orange, and (dented) for my-orange, it would be convenient to be
able to make (props my-orange) return the union of all these values:
(dented orange sweet round acidic).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro children (obj)
      `(gethash 'children ,obj))

    (defun parents (obj)
      (gethash 'parents obj))

    (defun set-parents (obj pars)
      (dolist (p (parents obj))
        (setf (children p)
          (delete obj (children p))))
      (setf (gethash 'parents obj) pars)
      (dolist (p pars)
        (pushnew obj (children p)))
      (maphier #'(lambda (obj)
               (setf (gethash 'ancestors obj)
                 (get-ancestors obj)))
           obj)
      pars)

    (defsetf parents set-parents)

    (defun maphier (fn obj)
      (funcall fn obj)
      (dolist (c (children obj))
        (maphier fn c)))

    (defun obj (&rest parents)
      (let ((obj (make-hash-table)))
        (setf (parents obj) parents)
        obj))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 25.9: Maintaining parent and child links.


We could have this if we allowed methods to apply some function to the
values of all the primary methods, instead of just returning the value
of the most specific. Figure 25.10 contains a macro which allows us to
define the way methods are combined, and a new version of
run-core-methods which can perform method combination.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro defcomb (name op)
      `(progn
         (defprop ,name t)
         (setf (get ',name 'mcombine)
           ,(case op
              (:standard nil)
              (:progn '#'(lambda (&rest args)
                   (car (last args))))
              (t op)))))

    (defun run-core-methods (obj name args &optional pri)
      (let ((comb (get name 'mcombine)))
        (if comb
        (if (symbolp comb)
            (funcall (case comb (:and #'comb-and)
                   (:or #'comb-or))

          (comb-normal comb obj name args))
          (multiple-value-prog1
           (progn (run-befores obj name args)
              (apply (or pri (rget obj name :primary))
                 obj args))
           (run-afters obj name args)))))

    (defun comb-normal (comb obj name args)
      (apply comb
         (mapcan #'(lambda (a)
                 (let* ((pm (meth- primary
                           (gethash name a)))
                    (val (if pm
                         (apply pm obj args))))
                   (if val (list val))))
             (ancestors obj))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 25.10: Method combination.


We define the form of combination for a method via defcomb, which takes
a method name and a second argument describing the desired combination.
Ordinarily this second argument should be a function. However, it can
also be one of :progn, :and, :or, or :standard. With the former three,
primary methods will be combined as though according to the
corresponding operator, while :standard indicates that we want the
traditional way of running methods.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun comb-and (obj name args ancs &optional (last t))
      (if (null ancs)
          last
        (let ((pm (meth- primary (gethash name (car ancs)))))
          (if pm
          (let ((new (apply pm obj args)))
            (and new
             (comb-and obj name args (cdr ancs) new)))
        (comb-and obj name args (cdr ancs) last)))))

    (defun comb-or (obj name args ancs)
      (and ancs
           (let ((pm (meth- primary (gethash name (car ancs)))))
         (or (and pm (apply pm obj args))
             (comb-or obj name args (cdr ancs))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 25.11: Method combination (continued).


The central function in Figure 25.10 is the new run-core-methods. If the
method being called has no mcombine property, then the method call
proceeds as before. Otherwise the mcombine of the method is either a
function (like +) or a keyword (like :or). In the former case, the
function is just applied to a list of the values returned by all the
primary methods.[fn:36] In the latter, we use the function
associated with the keyword to iterate over the primary methods.

The operators and and or have to be treated specially, as in Figure
25.11. They get special treatment not just because they are special
forms, but because they short-circuit evaluation:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (or 1 (princ "wahoo"))
    1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here nothing is printed because the or returns as soon as it sees a
non-nil argument. Similarly, a primary method subject to or combination
should never get called if a more specific method returns true. To
provide such short-circuiting for and and or, we use the distinct
functions comb-and and comb-or.

To implement our previous example, we would write:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq citrus (obj))

    (setq orange (obj citrus))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq my-orange (obj orange))

    (defmeth (props) citrus (c) '(round acidic))

    (defmeth (props) orange (o) '(orange sweet))

    (defmeth (props) my-orange (m) '(dented))

    (defcomb props #'(lambda (&rest args) (reduce #'union args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

after which props would return the union of all the primary method
values: [fn:37]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (props my-orange)
    (DENTED ORANGE SWEET ROUND ACIDIC)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Incidentally, this example suggests a choice that you only have when
doing object-oriented programming in Lisp: whether to store information
in slots or methods.

Afterward, if we wanted the props method to return to the default
behavior, we just set the method combination back to standard:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (defcomb props :standard)
    NIL
    > (props my-orange)
    (DENTED)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that before- and after-methods only run in standard method
combination. However, around-methods work the same as before.

The program presented in this section is intended as a model, not as a
real foundation for object-oriented programming. It was written for
brevity rather than efficiency. However, it is at least a working model,
and so could be used for experiments and prototypes. If you do want to
use the program for such purposes, one minor change would make it much
more efficient: don't calculate or store ancestor lists for objects with
only one parent.

<<Classes and Instances>><<SEC159>>

** 25.3 Classes and Instances
The program in the previous section was written to resemble CLOS as
closely as such a small program could. By understanding it we are
already a fair way towards understanding CLOS. In the next few sections
we will examine CLOS itself.

In our sketch, we made no syntactic distinction between classes and
instances, or between slots and methods. In CLOS, we use the defclass
macro to define a class, and we declare the slots in a list at the same
time:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass circle ()
      (radius center))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This expression says that the circle class has no superclasses, and two
slots, radius and center. We can make an instance of the circle class by
saying:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (make-instance 'circle)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Unfortunately, we have defined no way of referring to the slots of a
circle, so any instance we make is going to be rather inert. To get at a
slot we define an accessor function for it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass circle ()
      ((radius :accessor circle-radius)
       (center :accessor circle-center)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now if we make an instance of a circle, we can set its radius and center
slots by using setf with the corresponding accessor functions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setf (circle-radius (make-instance 'circle)) 2)
    2
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can do this kind of initialization right in the call to make-instance
if we define the slots to allow it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass circle ()
      ((radius :accessor circle-radius :initarg :radius)
       (center :accessor circle-center :initarg :center)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The :initarg keyword in a slot definition says that the following
argument should become a keyword parameter in make-instance. The value
of the keyword parameter will become the initial value of the slot:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (circle-radius (make-instance 'circle
    :radius 2
    :center '(0 . 0)))
    2
#+END_EXAMPLE

By declaring an :initform, we can also define slots which initialize
themselves. The visible slot of the shape class

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass shape ()
      ((color :accessor shape-color :initarg :color)
       (visible :accessor shape-visible :initarg :visible
            :initform t)))
#+END_EXAMPLE


will be set to t by default:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (shape-visible (make-instance 'shape))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

If a slot has both an initarg and an initform, the initarg takes
precedence when it is specified:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (shape-visible (make-instance 'shape :visible nil))
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Slots are inherited by instances and subclasses. If a class has more
than one superclass, it inherits the union of their slots. So if we
define the class screen-circle to be a subclass of both circle and
shape,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass screen-circle (circle shape)
      nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

then instances of screen-circle will have four slots, two inherited from
each grandparent. Note that a class does not have to create any new
slots of its own; this class exists just to provide something
instantiable that inherits from both circle and shape.

The accessors and initargs work for instances of screen-circle just as
they would for instances of circle or shape:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (shape-color (make-instance 'screen-circle
    :color 'red :radius 3))
    RED
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can cause every screen-circle to have some default initial color by
specifying an initform for this slot in the defclass:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass screen-circle (circle shape)
      ((color :initform 'purple)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now instances of screen-circle will be purple by default,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (shape-color (make-instance 'screen-circle))
    PURPLE
#+END_EXAMPLE

though it is still possible to initialize the slot otherwise by giving
an explicit :color initarg.

In our sketch of object-oriented programming, instances inherited values
directly from the slots in their parent classes. In CLOS, instances do
not have slots in the same way that classes do. We define an inherited
default for instances by defining an initform in the parent class. In a
way, this is more flexible, because as well as being a constant, an
initform can be an expression that returns a different value each time
it is evaluated:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass random-dot ()
      ((x :accessor dot-x :initform (random 100))
       (y :accessor dot-y :initform (random 100))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Each time we make an instance of a random-dot its x- and y-position will
be a random integer between 0 and 99:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (mapcar #'(lambda (name)
    (let ((rd (make-instance 'random-dot)))
    (list name (dot-x rd) (dot-y rd))))
    '(first second third))
    ((FIRST 25 8) (SECOND 26 15) (THIRD 75 59))
#+END_EXAMPLE

In our sketch, we also made no distinction between slots whose values
were to vary from instance to instance, and those which were to be
constant across the whole class. In CLOS we can specify that some slots
are to be shared--that is, their value is the same for every instance.
We do this by declaring the slot to have :allocation :class. (The
alternative is for a slot to have :allocation :instance, but since this
is the default there is no need to say so explicitly.) For example, if
all owls are nocturnal, then we can make the nocturnal slot of the owl
class a shared slot, and give it the initial value t:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass owl ()
      ((nocturnal :accessor owl-nocturnal
              :initform t
              :allocation :class)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now every instance of the owl class will inherit this slot:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (owl-nocturnal (make-instance 'owl))
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we change the "local" value of this slot in an instance, we are
actually altering the value stored in the class:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setf (owl-nocturnal (make-instance 'owl)) 'maybe)
    MAYBE
    > (owl-nocturnal (make-instance 'owl))
    MAYBE
#+END_EXAMPLE

This could cause some confusion, so we might like to make such a slot
read-only. When we define an accessor function for a slot, we create a
way of both reading and writing the slot's value. If we want the value
to be readable but not writable, we can do it by giving the slot just a
reader function, instead of a full-fledged accessor function:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass owl ()
      ((nocturnal :reader owl-nocturnal
              :initform t
              :allocation :class)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now attempts to alter the nocturnal slot of an instance will generate an
error:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setf (owl-nocturnal (make-instance 'owl)) nil)
    >>Error: The function (SETF OWL-NOCTURNAL) is undefined.
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<Methods>><<SEC160>>

** 25.4 Methods
Our sketch emphasized the similarity between slots and methods in a
language which provides lexical closures. In our program, a primary
method was stored and inherited in the same way as a slot value. The
only difference between a slot and a method was that defining a name as
a slot by

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defprop area)
#+END_EXAMPLE

made area a function which would simply retrieve and return a value,
while defining it as a method by

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defprop area t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

made area a function which would, after retrieving a value, funcall it
on its arguments.

In CLOS the functional units are still called methods, and it is
possible to define them so that they each seem to be a property of some
class. Here we define an area method for the circle class:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmethod area ((c circle))
      (* pi (expt (circle-radius c) 2)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The parameter list for this method says that it is a function of one
argument which applies to instances of the circle class.

We invoke this method like a function, just as in our sketch:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (area (make-instance 'circle :radius 1))
    3.14...
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can also define methods that take additional arguments:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmethod move ((c circle) dx dy)
      (incf (car (circle-center c)) dx)
      (incf (cdr (circle-center c)) dy)
      (circle-center c))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we call this method on an instance of circle, its center will be
shifted by #dx,dy#:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (move (make-instance 'circle :center '(1 . 1)) 2 3)
    (3 . 4)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The value returned by the method reflects the circle's new position.

As in our sketch, if there is a method for the class of an instance, and
for superclasses of that class, the most specific one runs. So if
unit-circle is a subclass of circle, with the following area method

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmethod area ((c unit-circle)) pi)
#+END_EXAMPLE

then this method, rather than the more general one, will run when we
call area on an instance of unit-circle.

When a class has multiple superclasses, their precedence runs left to
right. By defining the class patriotic-scoundrel as follows

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass scoundrel nil nil)

    (defclass patriot nil nil)

    (defclass patriotic-scoundrel (scoundrel patriot) nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

we specify that patriotic scoundrels are scoundrels first and patriots
second. When there is an applicable method for both superclasses,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmethod self-or-country? ((s scoundrel))
      'self)

    (defmethod self-or-country? ((p patriot))
      'country)
#+END_EXAMPLE

the method of the scoundrel class will run:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (self-or-country? (make-instance 'patriotic-scoundrel))
    SELF
#+END_EXAMPLE

The examples so far maintain the illusion that CLOS methods are methods
of some object. In fact, they are something more general. In the
parameter list of the move method, the element (c circle) is called a
specialized parameter; it says that this method applies when the first
argument to move is an instance of the circle class. In a CLOS
method,more than one parameter can be specialized. The following method
has two specialized and one optional unspecialized parameter:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmethod combine ((ic ice-cream) (top topping)
                &optional (where :here))
      (append (list (name ic) 'ice-cream)
          (list 'with (name top) 'topping)
          (list 'in 'a
            (case where
              (:here 'glass)
              (:to-go 'styrofoam))
            'dish)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is invoked when the first two arguments to combine are instances of
ice-cream and topping, respectively. If we define some minimal classes
to instantiate

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass stuff () ((name :accessor name :initarg :name)))

    (defclass ice-cream (stuff) nil)

    (defclass topping (stuff) nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

then we can define and run this method:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (combine (make-instance 'ice-cream :name 'fig)
    (make-instance 'topping :name 'olive)
    :here)
    (FIG ICE-CREAM WITH OLIVE TOPPING IN A GLASS DISH)
#+END_EXAMPLE

When methods specialize more than one of their parameters, it is
difficult to continue to regard them as properties of classes. Does our
combine method belong to the ice-cream class or the topping class? In
CLOS, the model of objects responding to messages simply evaporates.
This model seems natural so long as we invoke methods by saying
something like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (tell obj 'move 2 3)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then we are clearly invoking the move method of obj. But once we drop
this syntax in favor of a functional equivalent:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (move obj 2 3)
#+END_EXAMPLE

then we have to define move so that it dispatches on its first
argument--that is, looks at the type of the first argument and calls the
appropriate method.

Once we have taken this step, the question arises: why only allow
dispatching on the first argument? CLOS answers: why indeed? In CLOS,
methods can specialize any number of their parameters--and not just on
user-defined classes, but on Common Lisp types,[fn:38] and
even on individual objects. Here is a combine method that applies to
strings:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmethod combine ((s1 string) (s2 string) &optional int?)
      (let ((str (concatenate 'string s1 s2)))
        (if int? (intern str) str)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Which means not only that methods are no longer properties of classes,
but that we can use methods without defining classes at all.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (combine "I am not a " "cook.")
    "I am not a cook."
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here the second parameter is specialized on the symbol palindrome:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmethod combine ((s1 sequence) (x (eql 'palindrome))
                &optional (length :odd))
      (concatenate (type-of s1)
               s1
               (subseq (reverse s1)
                   (case length (:odd 1) (:even 0)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This particular method makes palindromes of any kind of sequence
elements: [fn:39]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (combine '(able was i ere) 'palindrome)
    (ABLE WAS I ERE I WAS ABLE)
#+END_EXAMPLE

At this point we no longer have object-oriented programming, but
something more general. CLOS is designed with the understanding that
beneath methods there is this concept of dispatch, which can be done on
more than one argument, and can be based on more than an argument's
class. When methods are built upon this more general notion, they become
independent of individual classes. Instead of adhering conceptually to
classes, methods now adhere to other methods with the same name. In CLOS
such a clump of methods is called a generic function. All our combine
methods implicitly define the generic function combine.

We can define generic functions explicitly with the defgeneric macro. It
is not necessary to call defgeneric to define a generic function, but it
can be a convenient place to put documentation, or some sort of
safety-net for errors. Here we do both:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defgeneric combine (x y &optional z)
      (:method (x y &optional z)
           "I can't combine these arguments.")
      (:documentation "Combines things."))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Since the method given here for combine doesn't specialize any of its
arguments, it will be the one called in the event no other method is
applicable.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (combine #'expt "chocolate")
    "I can't combine these arguments."
#+END_EXAMPLE

Before, this call would have generated an error.

Generic functions impose one restriction that we don't have when methods
are properties of objects: when all methods of the same name get joined
into one generic function, their parameter lists must agree. That's why
all our combine methods had an additional optional parameter. After
defining the first combine method to take up to three arguments, it
would have caused an error if we attempted to define another which only
took two.

CLOS requires that the parameter lists of all methods with the same name
be congruent. Two parameter lists are congruent if they have the same
number of required parameters, the same number of optional parameters,
and compatible use of &rest and &key. The actual keyword parameters
accepted by different methods need not be the same, but defgeneric can
insist that all its methods accept a certain minimal set. The following
pairs of parameter lists are all congruent:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (x) (a)
    (x &optional y) (a &optional b)
    (x y &rest z) (a b &rest c)
    (x y &rest z) (a b &key c d)
#+END_EXAMPLE

and the following pairs are not:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (x) (a b)
    (x &optional y) (a &optional b c)
    (x &optional y) (a &rest b)
    (x &key x y) (a)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Redefining methods is just like redefining functions. Since only
required parameters can be specialized, each method is uniquely
identified by its generic function and the types of its required
parameters. If we define another method with the same specializations,
it overwrites the original one. So by saying:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmethod combine ((x string) (y string)
                &optional ignore)
      (concatenate 'string x " + " y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmacro undefmethod (name &rest args)
      (if (consp (car args))
          (udm name nil (car args))
        (udm name (list (car args)) (cadr args))))

    (defun udm (name qual specs)
      (let ((classes (mapcar #'(lambda (s)
                     `(find-class ',s))
                 specs)))
        `(remove-method (symbol-function ',name)
                (find-method (symbol-function ',name)
                     ',qual
                     (list ,@classes)))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Figure 25.12: Macro for removing methods.


we redefine what combine does when its first two arguments are strings.

Unfortunately, if instead of redefining a method we want to remove it,
there is no built-in converse of defmethod. Fortunately, this is Lisp,
so we can write one. The details of how to remove a method by hand are
summarized in the implementation of undefmethod in Figure 25.12. We use
this macro by giving arguments similar to those we would give to
defmethod, except that instead of giving a whole parameter list as the
second or third argument, we give just the class-names of the required
parameters. So to remove the combine method for two strings, we say:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (undefmethod combine (string string))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Unspecialized arguments are implicitly of class t, so if we had defined
a method with required but unspecialized parameters:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmethod combine ((fn function) x &optional y)
      (funcall fn x y))
#+END_EXAMPLE

we could get rid of it by saying

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (undefmethod combine (function t))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we want to remove a whole generic function, we can do it the same way
we would remove the definition of any function, by calling fmakunbound:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (fmakunbound 'combine)
#+END_EXAMPLE

<<Auxiliary Methods and Combination>><<SEC161>>

** 25.5 Auxiliary Methods and Combination
Auxiliary methods worked in our sketch basically as they do in CLOS. So
far we have seen only primary methods, but we can also have before-,
after- and around-methods. Such auxiliary methods are defined by putting
a qualifying keyword after the method name in the call to defmethod. If
we define a primary speak method for the speaker class as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass speaker nil nil)

    (defmethod speak ((s speaker) string)
      (format t "~A" string))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then calling speak with an instance of speaker just prints the second
argument:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (speak (make-instance 'speaker)
    "life is not what it used to be")
    life is not what it used to be
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

By defining a subclass intellectual which wraps before- and
after-methods around the primary speak method,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass intellectual (speaker) nil)

    (defmethod speak :before ((i intellectual) string)
      (princ "Perhaps "))

    (defmethod speak :after ((i intellectual) string)
      (princ " in some sense"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

we can create a subclass of speakers which always have the last (and the
first) word:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (speak (make-instance 'intellectual)
    "life is not what it used to be")
    Perhaps life is not what it used to be in some sense
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

In standard method combination, the methods are called as described in
our sketch: all the before-methods, most specific first, then the most
specific primary method, then all the after-methods, most specific last.
So if we define before- or after-methods for the speaker superclass,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defmethod speak :before ((s speaker) string)
      (princ "I think "))
#+END_EXAMPLE

they will get called in the middle of the sandwich:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (speak (make-instance 'intellectual)
    "life is not what it used to be")
    Perhaps I think life is not what it used to be in some sense
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

Regardless of what before- or after-methods get called, the value
returned by the generic function is the value of the most specific
primary method--in this case, the nil returned by format.

This changes if there are around-methods. If one of the classes in an
object's family tree has an around-method--or more precisely, if there
is an around-method specialized for the arguments passed to the generic
function--the around-method will get called first, and the rest of the
methods will only run if the around-method decides to let them. As in
our sketch, an around- or primary method can invoke the next method by
calling a function: the function we defined as call-next is in CLOS
called call-next-method. There is also a next-method-p, analogous to our
next-p. With around-methods we can define another subclass of speaker
which is more circumspect:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass courtier (speaker) nil)

    (defmethod speak :around ((c courtier) string)
      (format t "Does the King believe that ~A? " string)
      (if (eq (read) 'yes)
          (if (next-method-p) (call-next-method))
        (format t "Indeed, it is a preposterous idea.~%"))
      'bow)
#+END_EXAMPLE

When the first argument to speak is an instance of the courtier class,
the courtier's tongue is now guarded by the around-method:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (speak (make-instance 'courtier) "kings will last")
    Does the King believe that kings will last? yes
    I think kings will last
    BOW
    > (speak (make-instance 'courtier) "the world is round")
    Does the King believe that the world is round? no
    Indeed, it is a preposterous idea.
    BOW
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that, unlike before- and after-methods, the value returned by the
around-method is returned as the value of the generic function.

Generally, methods are run as in this outline, which is reprinted from
Section 25.2:

1. The most specific around-method, if there is one.
2. Otherwise, in order:

   1. All before-methods, from most specific to least specific.
   2. The most specific primary method.
   3. All after-methods, from least specific to most specific.

This way of combining methods is called standard method combination. As
in our sketch, it is possible to define methods which are combined in
other ways: for example, for a generic function to return the sum of all
the applicable primary methods.

In our program, we specified how to combine methods by calling defcomb.
By default, methods were combined as in the outline above, but by
saying, for example,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defcomb price #'+)
#+END_EXAMPLE

we could cause the function price to return the sum of all the
applicable primary methods.

In CLOS this is called operator method combination. As in our program,
such method combination can be understood as if it resulted in the
evaluation of a Lisp expression whose first element was some operator,
and whose arguments were calls to the applicable primary methods, in
order of specificity. If we defined the price generic function to
combine values with +, and there were no applicable around-methods, it
would behave as though it were defined:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun price (&rest args)
      (+ (apply #most specific primary method# args)
         . . .
         (apply #least specific primary method# args)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If there are applicable around-methods, they take precedence, just as in
standard method combination. Under operator method combination, an
around-methodcan still call the next method via call-next-method.
However, primary methods can no longer use call-next-method. (This is a
difference from our sketch, where we left call-next available to such
methods.)

In CLOS, we can specify the type of method combination to be used by a
generic function by giving the optional :method-combination argument to
defgeneric:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defgeneric price (x)
      (:method-combination +))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now the price method will use + method combination. If we define some
classes with prices,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defclass jacket nil nil)

    (defclass trousers nil nil)

    (defclass suit (jacket trousers) nil)

    (defmethod price + ((jk jacket)) 350)

    (defmethod price + ((tr trousers)) 200)
#+END_EXAMPLE

then when we ask for the price of an instance of suit, we get the sum of
the applicable price methods:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (price (make-instance 'suit))
    550
#+END_EXAMPLE

The following symbols can be used as the second argument to defmethod or
in the :method-combination option to defgeneric: + and append list max
min nconc or progn

By calling define-method-combinationyou can define other kinds of method
combination; see CLTL2, p. 830.

Once you specify the method combination a generic function should use,
all methods for that function must use the same kind. Now it would cause
an error if we tried to use another operator (or :before or :after) as
the second argument in a defmethod for price. If we do want to change
the method combination of price we must remove the whole generic
function by calling fmakunbound.

<<SEC162>>

** 25.6 CLOS and Lisp
CLOS makes a good example of an embedded language. This kind of program
usually brings two rewards:

1. Embedded languages can be conceptually well-integrated with their
   environment, so that within the embedded language we can continue to
   think of programs in much the same terms.
2. Embedded languages can be powerful, because they take advantage of
   all the things that the base language already knows how to do.

CLOS wins on both counts. It is very well-integrated with Lisp, and it
makes good use of the abstractions that Lisp has already. Indeed, we can
often see Lisp through CLOS, the way we can see the shapes of objects
through a sheet draped over them.

It is no accident that we usually speak to CLOS through a layer of
macros. Macros do transformation,and CLOS is essentially a program which
takes programs built out of object-oriented abstractions, and translates
them into programs built out of Lisp abstractions.

As the first two sections suggested, the abstractions of object-oriented
programming map so neatly onto those of Lisp that one could almost call
the former a special case of the latter. The objects of object-oriented
programming can easily be implemented as Lisp objects, and their methods
as lexical closures. By taking advantage of such isomorphisms, we were
able to provide a rudimentary form of object-oriented programming in
just a few lines of code, and a sketch of CLOS in a few pages.

CLOS is a great deal larger and more powerful than our sketch, but not
so large as to disguise its roots as an embedded language. Take
defmethod as an example. Though CLTL2 does not mention it explicitly,
CLOS methods have all the power of lexical closures. If we define
several methods within the scope of some variable,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (let ((transactions 0))
      (defmethod withdraw ((a account) amt)
        (incf transactions)
        (decf (balance a) amt))
      (defmethod deposit ((a account) amt)
        (incf transactions)
        (incf (balance a) amt))
      (defun transactions ()
        transactions))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then at runtime they will share access to the variable, just like
closures. Methods can do this because, underneath the syntax, they are
closures. In the expansion of a defmethod, its body appears intact in
the body of a sharp-quoted lambda-expression.

Section 7.6 suggested that it was easier to conceive of how macros work
than what they mean. Likewise, the secret to understanding CLOS is to
understand how it maps onto the fundamental abstractions of Lisp.

<<When to Object>><<SEC163>>

** 25.7 When to Object
The object-oriented style provides several distinct benefits. Different
programs need these benefits to varying degrees. At one end of the
continuum there are programs--simulations, for example--which are most
naturally expressed in the abstractions of object-oriented programming.
At the other end are programs written in the object-oriented style
mainly to make them extensible.

Extensibility is indeed one of the great benefits of the object-oriented
style. Instead of being a single monolithic blob of code, a program is
written in small pieces, each labelled with its purpose. So later when
someone else wants to modify the program, it will be easy to find the
part that needs to be changed. If we want to change the way that objects
of type ob are displayed on the screen, we change the display method of
the ob class. If we want to make a new class of objects like obs but
different in a few respects, we can create a subclass of ob; in the
subclass, we change the properties we want, and all the rest will be
inherited by default from the ob class. And if we just want to make a
single ob which behaves differently from the rest, we can create a new
child of ob and modify the child's properties directly. If the program
was written carefully to begin with, we can make all these types of
modifications without even looking at the rest of the code. From this
point of view, an object-oriented program is a program organized like a
table: we can change it quickly and safely by looking up the appropriate
entry.

Extensibility demands the least from the object-oriented style. In fact,
it demands so little that an extensible program might not need to be
object-oriented at all. If the preceding chapters have shown anything,
they have shown that Lisp programs do not have to be monolithic blobs of
code. Lisp offers a whole range of options for extensibility. For
example, you could quite literally have a program organized like a
table: a program which consisted of a set of closures stored in an
array.

If it's extensibility you need, you don't have to choose between an
"object-oriented" and a "traditional" program. You can give a Lisp
program exactly the degree of extensibility it needs, often without
resorting to object-oriented techniques. A slot in a class is a global
variable. And just as it is inelegant to use a global variable where you
could use a parameter, it could be inelegant to build a world of classes
and instances when you could do the same thing with less effort in plain
Lisp. With the addition of CLOS, Common Lisp has become the most
powerful object-oriented language in widespread use. Ironically, it is
also the language in which object-oriented programming is least
necessary.

* A. Packages
Packages are Common Lisp's way of grouping code into modules. Early
dialects of Lisp contained a symbol-table, called the oblist, which
listed all the symbols read so far by the system. Through a symbol's
entry on the oblist, the system had access to things like its value and
its property list. A symbol listed in the oblist was said to be
interned.

Recent dialects of Lisp have split the concept of the oblist into
multiple packages. Now a symbol is not merely interned, but interned in
a particular package. Packages support modularity because symbols
interned in one package are only accessible in other packages (except by
cheating) if they are explicitly declared to be so.

A package is a kind of Lisp object. The current package is always stored
in the global variable *package*. When Common Lisp starts up, the
current package will be the user package: either user (in CLTL1
implementations), or common-lisp-user (in CLTL2 implementations).

Packages are usually identified by their names, which are strings. To
find the name of the current package, try:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (package-name *package*)
    "COMMON-LISP-USER"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Usually a symbol is interned in the package that was current at the time
it was read. To find the package in which a symbol is interned, we can
use symbol-package:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (symbol-package 'foo)
    #<Package "COMMON-LISP-USER" 4CD15E>
    381
#+END_EXAMPLE

The return value here is the actual package object. For future use,
let's give foo a value:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (setq foo 99)
    99
#+END_EXAMPLE

By calling in-package we can switch to a new package, creating it if
necessary: [fn:40]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (in-package 'mine :use 'common-lisp)
    #<Package "MINE" 63390E>
#+END_EXAMPLE

At this point there should be eerie music, because we are in a different
world: foo here is not what it used to be.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    MINE> foo
    >>Error: FOO has no global value.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Why did this happen? Because the foo we set to 99 above is a distinct symbol
from foo here in mine. [fn:41]

To refer to the original foo from outside the user package, we must prefix the
package name and two colons:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    MINE> common-lisp-user::foo
    99
#+END_EXAMPLE

So different symbols with the same print-name can coexist in different
packages. There can be one foo in package common-lisp-user and another
foo in package mine, and they will be distinct symbols. In fact, that's
partly the point of packages: if you're writing your program in a
separate package, you can choose names for your functions and variables
without worrying that someone will use the same name for something else.
Even if they use the same name, it won't be the same symbol.

Packages also provide a means of information-hiding. Programs must refer
to functions and variables by their names. If you don't make a given
name available outside your package, it becomes unlikely that code in
another package will be able to use or modify what it refers to.

In programs it's usually bad style to use package prefixes with double
colons. By doing so you are violating the modularity that packages are
supposed to provide. If you have to use a double colon to refer to a
symbol, it's because someone didn't want you to.

Usually one should only refer to symbols which have been exported. By
exporting a symbol from the package in which it is interned, we cause it
to be visible to other packages. To export a symbol we call (you guessed
it) export:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    MINE> (in-package 'common-lisp-user)
    #<Package "COMMON-LISP-USER" 4CD15E>
    > (export 'bar)
    T
    > (setq bar 5)
    5
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now when we return to mine, we can refer to bar with only a single
colon, because it is a publicly available name:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > (in-package 'mine)
    #<Package "MINE" 63390E>
    MINE> common-lisp-user:bar
    5
#+END_EXAMPLE

By importing bar into mine we can go one step further, and make mine
actually share the symbol bar with the user package:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    MINE> (import 'common-lisp-user:bar)
    T
    MINE> bar
    5
#+END_EXAMPLE

After importing bar we can refer to it without any package qualifier at
all. The two packages now share the same symbol; there can't be a
distinct mine:bar.

What if there already was one? In that case, the call to import would
have caused an error, as we see if we try to import foo:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    MINE> (import 'common-lisp-user::foo)
    >>Error: FOO is already present in MINE.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Before, when we tried unsuccessfully to evaluate foo in mine, we thereby
caused a symbol foo to be interned there. It had no global value and
therefore generated an error, but the interning happened simply as a
consequence of typing its name. So now when we try to import foo into
mine, there is already a symbol there with the same name.

We can also import symbols en masse by defining one package to use
another:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    MINE> (use-package 'common-lisp-user)
    T
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now all symbols exported by the user package will automatically be
imported by mine. (If foo had been exported by the user package, this
call would also have generated an error.)

As of CLTL2, the package containing the names of built-in operators and
variables is called common-lisp instead of lisp, and new packages no
longer use it by default. Since we used this package in the call to
in-package which created mine, all of Common Lisp's names will be
visible here:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    MINE> #'cons
    #<Compiled-Function CONS 462A3E>
#+END_EXAMPLE

You're practically compelled to make any new package use common-lisp (or
some other package containing Lisp operators). Otherwise you wouldn't
even be able to get out of the new package.

As with compilation, operations on packages are not usually done at the
toplevel like this. More often the calls are contained in source files.
Generally it will suffice to begin a file with an in-package and a
defpackage. (The defpackage macro is new in CLTL2, but some older
implementations provide it.) Here is what you might put at the top of a
file containing a distinct package of code:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (in-package 'my-application :use 'common-lisp)

    (defpackage my-application
      (:use common-lisp my-utilities)
      (:nicknames app)
      (:export win lose draw))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will cause the code in the file--or more precisely, the names in
the file--to be in the package my-application. As well as common-lisp,
this package uses my-utilities, so any symbols exported thence can
appear without any package prefix in the file.

The my-application package itself exports just three symbols: win, lose,
and draw. Since the call to in-package gave my-application the nickname
app, code in other packages will be able to refer to them as e.g.
app:win.

The kind of modularity provided by packages is actually a bit odd. We
have modules not of objects, but of names. Every package that uses
common-lisp imports the name cons, because common-lisp includes a
function with that name. But in consequence a variable called cons would
also be visible every package that used common-lisp. And the same thing
goes for Common Lisp's other name-spaces. If packages are confusing,
this is the main reason why; they're not based on objects, but on names.

Things having to do with packages tend to happen at read-time, not
runtime, which can lead to some confusion. The second expression we
typed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (symbol-package 'foo)
#+END_EXAMPLE

returned the value it did because reading the query created the answer.
To evaluate this expression, Lisp had to read it, which meant interning
foo.

As another example, consider this exchange, which appeared above:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    MINE> (in-package 'common-lisp-user)
    #<Package "COMMON-LISP-USER" 4CD15E>
    > (export 'bar)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Usually two expressions typed into the toplevel are equivalent to the
same two expressions enclosed within a single progn. Not in this case.
If we try saying

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    MINE> (progn (in-package 'common-lisp-user)
    (export 'bar))
    >>Error: MINE::BAR is not accessible in COMMON-LISP-USER.
#+END_EXAMPLE

we get an error instead. This happens because the whole progn expression
is processed by read before being evaluated. When read is called, the
current package is mine, so bar is taken to be mine:bar. It is as if we
had asked to export this symbol, instead of common-lisp-user:bar, from
the user package.

The way packages are defined makes it a nuisance to write programs which
use symbols as data. For example, if we define noise as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (in-package 'other :use 'common-lisp)

    (defpackage other
      (:use common-lisp)
      (:export noise))

    (defun noise (animal)
      (case animal
        (dog 'woof)
        (cat 'meow)
        (pig 'oink)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then if we call noise from another package with an unqualified symbol as
an argument, it will usually fall off the end of the case clauses and
return nil:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    OTHER> (in-package 'common-lisp-user)
    #<Package "COMMON-LISP-USER" 4CD15E>
    > (other:noise 'pig)
    NIL
#+END_EXAMPLE

That's because what we passed as an argument was common-lisp-user:pig(no
offense intended), while the case key is other:pig. To make noise work
as one would expect, we would have to export all six symbols used within
it, and import them into any package from which we intended to call
noise.

In this case, we could evade the problem by using keywords instead of
ordinary symbols. If noise had been defined

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (defun noise (animal)
      (case animal
        (:dog :woof)
        (:cat :meow)
        (:pig :oink)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

then we could safely call it from any package:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    OTHER> (in-package 'common-lisp-user)
    #<Package "COMMON-LISP-USER" 4CD15E>
    > (other:noise :pig)
    :OINK
#+END_EXAMPLE

Keywords are like gold: universal and self-evaluating. They are visible
everywhere, and they never have to be quoted. A symbol-driven function
like defanaph (page 223) should nearly always be written to use
keywords.

Packages are a rich source of confusion. This introduction to the
subject has barely scratched the surface. For all the details, see
CLTL2, Chapter 11.

  single lambda-expression. We can, however, generate a recursive
  function by writing a function to take itself as an additional
  argument,

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (setq fact
            #'(lambda (f n)
            (if (= n 0)
                1
              (* n (funcall f f (- n 1))))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  and then passing it to a function that will return a closure in which
  original function is called on itself:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (defun recurser (fn)
        #'(lambda (&rest args)
            (apply fn fn args)))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Passing fact to this function yields a regular factorial function,

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      > (funcall (recurser fact) 8)
      40320
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  which could have been expressed directly as:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      ((lambda (f) #'(lambda (n) (funcall f f n)))
       #'(lambda (f n)
           (if (= n 0)
           1
             (* n (funcall f f (- n 1))))))

            (unless (compiled-function-p (symbol-function s))
          (print s)
          (compile s)))))

            lst
          (prog1 (nr2 lst)

      (defun nr2 (lst)
        (let ((c (cdr lst)))
          (prog1 (if (null (cdr c))
                 c
               (nr2 c))
            (setf (cdr c) lst))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- *43* :: Good design always puts a premium on economy, but there is an
  additional reason that programs should be dense. When a program is
  dense, you can see more of it at once.

  People know intuitively that design is easier when one has a broad
  view of one's work. This is why easel painters use long-handled
  brushes, and often step back from their work. This is why generals
  position themselves on high ground, even if they are thereby exposed
  to enemy fire. And it is why programmers spend a lot of money to look
  at their programs on large displays instead of small ones.

  Dense programs make the most of one's field of vision. A general
  cannot shrink a battle to fit on a table-top, but Lisp allows you to
  perform corresponding feats of abstraction in programs. And the more
  you can see of your program at once, the more likely it is to turn out
  as a unified whole.

  This is not to say that one should make one's programs shorter at any
  cost. If you take all the newlines out of a function, you can fit it
  on one line, but this does not make it easier to read. Dense code
  means code which has been made smaller by abstraction, not
  text-editing.

  Imagine how hard it would be to program if you had to look at your
  code on a display half the size of the one you're used to. Making your
  code twice as dense will make programming that much easier.

  #+END_EXAMPLE

- *49* :: Written as it is, find2 will generate an error if it runs off
  the end of a dotted list:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      > (find2 #'oddp '(2 . 3))
      >>Error: 3 is not a list.
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  CLTL2 (p. 31) says that it is an error to give a dotted list to a
  function expecting a list. Implementations are not required to detect
  this error; some do, some don't. The situation gets murky with
  functions that take sequences generally. A dotted list is a cons, and
  conses are sequences, so a strict reading of CLTL would seem to
  require that

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (find-if #'oddp '(2 . 3))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  return nil instead of generating an error, because find-if is supposed
  to take a sequence as an argument.

  Implementations vary here. Some generate an error anyway, and others
  return nil. However, even implementations which follow the strict
  reading in the case above tend to deviate in e.g. the case of
  (concatenate 'cons '(a . b) '(c . d)), which is likely to return (a c
  . d) instead of (a c).

  In this book, the utilities which expect lists expect proper lists.
  Those which operate on sequences will accept dotted lists. However, in
  general it would be asking for trouble to pass dotted lists to any
  function that wasn't specifically intended for use on them.

- *66* :: If we could tell how many parameters each function had, we
  could write a version of compose so that, in f #g, multiple values
  returned by g would become the corresponding arguments to f. In CLTL2,
  the new function function-lambda-expression returns a
  lambda-expression representing the original source code of a function.
  However, it has the option of returning nil, and usually does so for
  built-in functions. What we really need is a function that would take
  a function as an argument and return its parameter list.
- *73* :: A version of rfind-if which searches for whole subtrees could
  be defined as follows:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (defun rfind-if (fn tree)
        (if (funcall fn tree)
            tree
          (if (atom tree)
          nil
            (or (rfind-if fn (car tree))
            (and (cdr tree) (rfind-if fn (cdr tree)))))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  The function passed as the first argument would then have to apply to
  both atoms and lists:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      > (rfind-if (fint #'atom #'oddp) '(2 (3 4) 5))
      3
      > (rfind-if (fint #'listp #'cddr) '(a (b c d e)))
      (B C D E)

- *106* :: When Section 8.1 says that a certain kind of operator can
  only be written as a macro, it means, can only be written by the user
  as a macro. Special forms can do everything macros can, but there is
  no way to define new ones.

  A special form is so called because its evaluation is treated as a
  special case. In an interpreter, you could imagine eval as a big cond
  expression:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (defun eval (expr env)
        (cond ...
          ((eq (car expr) 'quote) (cadr expr))
          ...
          (t (apply (symbol-function (car expr))
                (mapcar #'(lambda (x)
                        (eval x env))
                    (cdr expr))))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Most expressions are handled by the default clause, which says to get
  the function referred to in the car, evaluate all the arguments in the
  cdr, and return the result of applying the former to the latter.
  However, an expression of the form (quote x) should not be treated
  this way: the whole point of a quote is that its argument is not
  evaluated. So eval has to have one clause which deals specifically
  with quote.

  Language designers regard special forms as something like
  constitutional amendments. It is necessary to have a certain number,
  but the fewer the better. The special forms in Common Lisp are listed
  in CLTL2, p. 73.

  The preceding sketch of eval is inaccurate in that it retrieves the
  function before evaluating the arguments, whereas in Common Lisp the
  order of these two operations is deliberately unspecified. For a
  sketch of eval in Scheme, see Abelson and Sussman, p. 299.


- *115* :: It's reasonable to say that a utility function is justified
  when it pays for itself in brevity. Utilities written as macros may
  have to meet a stricter standard. Reading macro calls can be more
  difficult than reading function calls, because they can violate the
  Lisp evaluation rule. In Common Lisp, this rule says that the value of
  an expression is the result of calling the function named in the car
  on the arguments given in the cdr, evaluated left-to-right. Since
  functions all follow this rule, it is no more difficult to understand
  a call to find2 than to find-books (page 42).

  However, macros generally do not preserve the Lisp evaluation rule.
  (If one did, you could have used a function instead.) In principle,
  each macro defines its own evaluation rule, and the reader can't know
  what it is without reading the macro's definition. So a macro,
  depending on how clear it is, may have to save much more than its own
  length in order to justify its existence.

- *126* :: The definition of for given in Figure 9.2, like several
  others defined in this book, is correct on the assumption that the
  initforms in a do expression will be evaluated left-to-right. CLTL2
  (p. 165) says that this holds for the stepforms, but says nothing one
  way or the other about the initforms.

  There is good cause to believe that this is merely an oversight.
  Usually if the order of some operations is unspecified, CLTL will say
  so. And there is no reason that the order of evaluation of the
  initforms of a do should be unspecified, since the evaluation of a let
  is left-to-right, and so is the evaluation of the stepforms in do
  itself.

- *128* :: Common Lisp's gentemp is like gensym except that it interns
  the symbol it creates. Like gensym, gentemp maintains an internal
  counter which it uses to make print names. If the symbol it wants to
  create already exists in the current package, it increments the
  counter and tries again:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      > (gentemp)
      T1
      > (setq t2 1)
      1
      > (gentemp)
      T3
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  and so tries to ensure that the symbol created will be unique.
  However, it is still possible to imagine name conflicts involving
  symbols created by gentemp. Though gentemp can guarantee to produce a
  symbol not seen before, it cannot foresee what symbols might be
  encountered in the future. Since gensyms work perfectly well and are
  always safe, why use gentemp? Indeed, for macros the only advantage of
  gentemp is that the symbols it makes can be written out and read back
  in, and in such cases they are certainly not guaranteed to be unique.

- *131* :: The capture of function names would be a more serious problem
  in Scheme, due to its single name-space. Not until 1991 did the Scheme
  standard suggest any official way of defining macros. Scheme's current
  provision for hygienic macros differs greatly from defmacro. For
  details, and a bibliography of recent research on the subject, see the
  most recent Scheme report.

- *158* :: Instead of writing mvpsetq, it would be cleaner to define an
  inversion for values. Then instead of

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (mvpsetq (w x) (values y z) ...)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  we could say

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (psetf (values w x) (values y z) ...)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Defining an inversion for values would also render multiple-value-setq
  unnecessary. Unfortunately, as things stand in Common Lisp it is
  impossible to define such an inversion; get-setf-method won't return
  more than one store variable, and presumably the expansion function of
  psetf wouldn't know what to do with them if it did.

- *180* :: One of the lessons of setf is that certain classes of macros
  can hide truly enormous amounts of computation and yet leave the
  source code perfectly comprehensible. Eventually setf may be just one
  of a class of macros for programming with assertions.

  For example, it might be useful to have a macro insist which took
  certain expressions of the form (predicate . arguments), and would
  make them true if they weren't already. As setf has to be told how to
  invert references, this macro would have to be told how to make
  expressions true. In the general case, such a macro call might amount
  to a call to Prolog.

- *213* :: The constant least-negative-normalized-double-float and its
  three cousins have the longest names in Common Lisp, with 38
  characters each. The operator with the longest name is
  get-setf-method-multiple-value, with 30.

  The following expression returns a list, from longest to shortest, of
  all the symbols visible in the current package:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (let ((syms nil))
        (do-symbols (s)
          (push s syms))
        (sort syms
          #'(lambda (x y)
              (> (length (symbol-name x))
                 (length (symbol-name y))))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- *217* :: As of CLTL2, the expansion function of a macro is supposed to
  be defined in the environment where the defmacro expression appears.
  This should make it possible to give propmacro the cleaner definition:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (defmacro propmacro (propname)
        `(defmacro ,propname (obj)
           `(get ,obj ',propname)))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  But CLTL2 does not explicitly state whether the propname form
  originally passed to propmacro is part of the lexical environment in
  which the inner defmacro occurs. In principle, it seems that if color
  were defined with (propmacro color), it should be equivalent to:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (let ((propname 'color))
        (defmacro color (obj)
          `(get ,obj ',propname)))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  or

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (let ((propname 'color))
        (defmacro color (obj)
          (list 'get obj (list 'quote propname))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  However, in at least some CLTL2 implementations, the new version of
  propmacro does not work.

  In CLTL1, the expansion function of a macro was considered to be
  defined in the null lexical environment. So for maximum portability,
  macro definitions should avoid using the enclosing environment anyway.

- *238* :: Functions like match are sometimes described as doing
  unification. They don't, quite; match will successfully match (f ?x)
  and ?x, but those two expressions should not unify.

  For a description of unification, see: Nilsson, Nils J.
  Problem-Solving Methods in Artificial Intelligence. McGraw-Hill, New
  York, 1971, pp. 175-178.

- *244* :: It's not really necessary to set unbound variables to
  gensyms, or to call gensym? at runtime. The expansion-generating code
  in Figures 18.7 and 18.8 could be written to keep track of the
  variables for which binding code had already been generated. To do
  this the code would have to be turned inside-out, however: instead of
  generating the expansion on the way back up the recursion, it would
  have to be accumulated on the way down.
- *244* :: A symbol like ?x occurring in the pattern of an if-match
  always denotes a new variable, just as a symbol in the car of a let
  binding clause does. So although Lisp variables can be used in
  patterns, pattern variables from outer queries cannot--you can use the
  same symbol, but it will denote a new variable. To test that two lists
  have the same first element, it wouldn't work to write:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (if-match (?x . ?rest1) lst1
            (if-match (?x . ?rest2) lst2
                  ?x))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  In this case, the second ?x is a new variable. If both lst1 and lst2
  had at least one element, this expression would always return the car
  of lst2. However, since you can use (non-?ed) Lisp variables in the
  pattern of an if-match, you can get the desired effect by writing:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (if-match (?x . ?rest1) lst1
            (let ((x ?x))
              (if-match (x . ?rest2) lst2
                    ?x)))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  The restriction, and the solution, apply to the with-answer and
  with-inference macros defined in Chapters 19 and 24 as well.

- *254* :: If it were a problem that "unbound" pattern variables were
  nil, you could have them bound to a distinct gensym by saying
  (defconstant unbound (gensym)) and then replacing the line

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

  #+END_EXAMPLE

  in with-answer with:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

      (define failsym '@)

           (lambda (cc)
             (push *paths*
               (lambda () (cc (choose (cdr choices)))))
             (car choices)))))

- *298* :: The continuation-passing macros defined in Chapter 20 depend
  heavily on the optimization of tail calls. Without it they may not
  work for large problems. For example, at the time of printing, few
  computers have enough memory to allow the Prolog defined in Chapter 24
  to run the zebra benchmark without the optimization of tail calls.
  (Warning: some Lisps crash when they run out of stack space.)
- *303* :: It's also possible to define a depth-first correct choose
  that works by explicitly avoiding circular paths. Here is a definition
  in T:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (define *paths* ())

      (define failsym '@)

      (define *choice-pts* (make-symbol-table))

      (define-syntax (true-choose choices)
        `(choose-fn ,choices ',(generate-symbol t)))

      (define (choose-fn choices tag)
        (if (null? choices)
            (fail)
          (call-with-current-continuation
           (lambda (cc)
             (push *paths*
               (lambda () (cc (choose-fn (cdr choices)
                             tag))))
             (if (mem equal? (car choices)
              (table-entry *choice-pts* tag))
             (fail)
           (car (push (table-entry *choice-pts* tag)
                  (car choices))))))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  In this version, true-choose becomes a macro. (The T define-syntax is
  like defmacro except that the macro name is put in the car of the
  parameter list.) This macro expands into a call to choose-fn, a
  function like the depth-first choose defined in Figure 22.4, except
  that it takes an additional tag argument to identify choice-points.
  Each value returned by a true-choose is recorded in the global
  hash-table *choice-pts*. If a given true-choose is about to return a
  value it has already returned, it fails instead. There is no need to
  change fail itself; we can use the fail defined on page 396.

  This implementation assumes that paths are of finite length. For
  example, it would allow path as defined in Figure 22.13 to find a path
  from a to e in the graph displayed in Figure 22.11 (though not
  necessarily a direct one). But the true-choose defined above wouldn't
  work for programs with an infinite search-space:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (define (guess x)
        (guess-iter x 0))

      (define (guess-iter x g)
        (if (= x g)
            g
          (guess-iter x (+ g (true-choose '(-1 0 1))))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  With true-choose defined as above, (guess n) would only terminate for
  non-positive n.

  How we define a correct choose also depends on what we call a choice
  point. This version treats each (textual) call to true-choose as a
  choice point. That might be too restrictive for some applications. For
  example, if two-numbers (page 291) used this version of choose, it
  would never return the same pair of numbers twice, even if it was
  called by several different functions. That might or might not be what
  we want, depending on the application.

  Note also that this version is intended for use only in compiled code.
  In interpreted code, the macro call might be expanded repeatedly, each
  time generating a new gensymed tag.

- *312* :: The original ATN system included operators for manipulating
  registers on the stack while in a sub-network. These could easily be
  added, but there is also a more general solution: to insert a
  lambda-expression to be applied to the register stack directly into
  the code of an arc body. For example, if the node mods (page 316) had
  the following line inserted into the body of its outgoing arc,

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (defnode mods
        (cat n mods/n
             ((lambda (regs)
            (append (butlast regs) (setr a 1 (last regs)))))
             (setr mods *)))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  then following the arc (however deep) would set the the topmost
  instance of the register a (the one visible when traversing the
  topmost ATN) to 1.

- *323* :: If necessary, it would be easy to modify the Prolog to take
  advantage of an existing database of facts. The solution would be to
  make prove (page 336) a nested choose:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      (=defun prove (query binds)
          (choose
           (choose-bind b2 (lookup (car query) (cdr query) binds)
                    (=values b2))
           (choose-bind r *rules*
                    (=funcall r query binds))))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- *325* :: To test quickly whether there is any match for a query, you
  could use the following macro:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

        `(block nil
           (with-inference ,expr
                   (return t))))

- *349* :: The lack of a distinct name for the concepts underlying Lisp
  may be a serious barrier to the language's acceptance. Somehow one can
  say "We need to use C++ because we want to do object-oriented
  programming," but it doesn't sound nearly as convincing to say "We
  need to use Lisp because we want to do Lisp programming."

  To administrative ears, this sounds like circular reasoning. Such ears
  would rather hear that Lisp's value hinged on a single, easily
  understood concept. For years we have tried to oblige them, with
  little success. Lisp has been described as a "list-processing
  language," a language for "symbolic computation," and most recently, a
  "dynamic language." None of these phrases captures more than a
  fraction of what Lisp is about. When retailed through college
  textbooks on programming languages, they become positively misleading.

  Efforts to sum up Lisp in a single phrase are probably doomed to
  failure, because the power of Lisp arises from the combination of at
  least five or six features. Perhaps we should resign ourselves to the
  fact that the only accurate name for what Lisp offers is Lisp.

- *352* :: For efficiency, sort doesn't guarantee to preserve the order
  of sequence elements judged equal by the function given as the second
  argument. For example, a valid Common Lisp implementation could do
  this:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      > (let ((v #((2 . a) (3 . b) (1 . c) (1 . d))))
      (sort (copy-seq v) #'< :key #'car))
      #((1 . D) (1 . C) (2 . A) (3 . B))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Note that the relative order of the first two elements has been
  reversed. The built-in stable-sort provides a way of sorting which
  won't reorder equal elements:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      > (let ((v #((2 . a) (3 . b) (1 . c) (1 . d))))
      (stable-sort (copy-seq v) #'< :key #'car))
      #((1 . C) (1 . D) (2 . A) (3 . B))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  It is a common error to assume that sort works like stable-sort.
  Another common error is to assume that sort is nondestructive. In
  fact, both sort and stable-sort can alter the sequence they are told
  to sort. If you don't want this to happen, you should sort a copy. The
  call to stable-sort in get-ancestors is safe because the list to be
  sorted has been freshly made.

[fn:10] Except perhaps remove-if-not, which is used
  more often than remove-if.
[fn:11] Under dynamic scope, we could write something
  like make-adder, but it would hardly ever work. The binding of n would
  be determined by the environment in which the returned function was
  eventually called, and we might not have any control over that.
[fn:12] In one widely used Common Lisp, functionp
  erroneously returns true for t and nil. In that implementation it
  won't work to give either as the second argument to lrec.
[fn:13] In some implementations, you may have to set
  *print-circle* to t before these functions can be displayed.
[fn:14] This version assumes that the network is a
  tree, which it must be in this application.
[fn:15] Backquote can also be used to create vectors,
  but this is rarely done in macro definitions.
[fn:16] This macro is defined a little oddly to avoid
  using gensyms. A better definition is given on page 150.
[fn:17] This version is written in this strange way to
  avoid using gensyms, which are not introduced till later.
[fn:18] 5 For an example of macro where this
  distinction matters, see the note on page 393.
[fn:19] Except functions compiled inline, which impose
  the same restrictions on redefinition as macros.
[fn:20] Made from, in the sense that lists are the
  input to the compiler. Functions are no longer made of lists, as they
  used to be in some earlier dialects.
[fn:21] For clarity, this version ignores all the
  bookkeeping that defun must perform.
[fn:22] The definition of this macro anticipates the
  next chapter by using gensyms. Their purpose will be explained
  shortly.
[fn:23] This macro is used only as an example. Really
  it should neither be implemented as a macro, nor use the inefficient
  algorithm that it does. For a proper definition, see page 50.
[fn:24] ~`',(foo)~ is equivalent to ~`(quote ,(foo))~.
[fn:25] It's not impossible to write an iteration
  function which doesn't need its argument wrapped up in a function. We
  could write a function that called eval on expressions passed to it as
  arguments. For an explanation of why it's usually bad to call eval,
  see page 278.
[fn:26] This definition is not correct, as the
  following section will explain.
[fn:27] A function name in the general sense: either
  1+ or (lambda (x) (+ x 1)).
[fn:28] The third value is currently always a list of
  one element. It is returned as a list to provide the (so far
  unconsummated) potential to store multiple values in generalized
  variables.
[fn:29] Built-in functions should not be memoized in
  this way, though. Common Lisp forbids the redefinition of built-in
  functions.
[fn:30] Although one tends to think of and and or
  together, there would be no point in writing an anaphoric version of
  or. An argument in an or expression is evaluated only if the previous
  argument evaluated to nil, so there would be nothing useful for an
  anaphor to refer to in an aor.
[fn:31] Though the abbreviation can't be passed to
  apply or funcall.
[fn:32] Functions created by =defun are deliberately
  given interned names, to make it possible to trace them. If tracing
  were never necessary, it would be safer to gensym the names.
[fn:33] Since the order of argument evaluation is
  unspecified in Scheme (as opposed to Common Lisp, which specifies
  left-to-right), this call might also return (THE SUM OF 5 2).
[fn:34] If desired, the exported interface to this
  code could consist of just a single operator, because (fail) is
  equivalent to (choose).
[fn:35] Many of the concepts used in this chapter,
  including this sense of bindings, are explained in Section 18.4.
[fn:36] A more sophisticated version of this code
  could use reduce to avoid consing here.
[fn:37] Since the combination function for props calls
  union, the list elements will not necessarily be in this order.
[fn:38] Or more precisely, on the type-like classes
  that CLOS defines in parallel with the Common Lisp type hierarchy.
[fn:39] In one (otherwise excellent) Common Lisp implementation, concatenate
  will not accept cons as its first argument, so this call will not work.
[fn:40] In older implementations of Common Lisp, omit the ~:use~ argument.
[fn:41] Some implementations of Common Lisp print the package name before the
toplevel prompt whenever we are not in the user package. This is not required,
but it is a nice touch.
